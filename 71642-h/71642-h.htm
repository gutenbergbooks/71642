</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">With Boone on the Frontier</span>” relates the
adventures of two youths who, with their families,
go westward into what was at that time the
wilderness of Kentucky, to join Daniel Boone in
settling what has since become one of the richest
and most prosperous of our States.</p>

<p>The history of this movement, and the history
of the man who was its greatest leader, are as
fascinating as the most exciting novel ever written.
Daniel Boone was a character almost
unique in American history, a man the very embodiment
of pluck and energy, and one who knew
neither fear nor the meaning of the word fail.
For years he had his eye on the great green fields
of Kentucky, and he resolved, in spite of the
dangers from natural causes and from the Indians,
to open up this territory to the hundreds of pioneers
who had become tired of life along the
eastern seacoast or close to it, and who wanted to
go where they would be less under the rule of
those English who were making themselves offensive
at that time. While those in the East were
fighting the War for Independence he and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span>
trusty followers were working equally hard to
give to this nation a stretch of land of which any
people might well be proud.</p>

<p>The first settlement in Kentucky was at Boonesborough,
about eighteen miles to the southeast
of Lexington, on the Kentucky River. To-day
this village is of small importance, but at that
time, in 1775, it boasted of a fort which, built
under the directions of Daniel Boone, was a rallying
point for all the settlers of that territory and a
place to which they fled for safety at the first sign
of an Indian uprising. It is in and around this
fort that many incidents of the present tale occur.</p>

<p>It may be that some, in reading this story, will
deem many of the statements made therein overdrawn.
Such is far from being the fact. The
days in which Daniel Boone lived were full of
dire peril to those who lived on the frontier, or
who attempted to push further westward over the
hunting grounds of the jealous red men, and
many were the outrages committed by the Indians,
not alone on the men and boys among the
pioneers, but also among the women and girls,
and even the little children. Let us all be thankful
that such days are now past never to return.</p>

<small>TWO BOYS OF THE WILDERNESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hark</span>, Joe, what was that?”</p>

<p>“It sounded like the report of a gun, Harry.
But I didn’t imagine that anybody was within
gunshot of this place outside of ourselves.”</p>

<p>“That was what I was thinking. Do you imagine
any of those Indians we met yesterday had
guns?” went on Harry Parsons thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see any,” answered Joe Winship.
“And if they had ’em I think we would have seen
’em,” he added, as he took up his gun from where
it was resting against a tree and looked at the
priming.</p>

<p>“We didn’t come out here to have trouble,”
continued Harry Parsons. “We only came to
see if we couldn’t bag a fine deer or two. If
those Indians followed our party——”</p>

<p>The youth came to a stop, for at that instant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
another gunshot rang out, somewhat closer than
the first which had attracted their attention.
Then came a rush through the forest and a few
seconds later four beautiful deer burst into view.</p>

<p>“Deer!” cried Joe Winship, and leveled his
gun at the nearest of the game.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot, Joe!” cried his companion.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“If the Indians are after ’em we may have
trouble.”</p>

<p>There was no time to argue the matter, for even
as Harry Parsons spoke the deer leaped the small
brook which wound its way through the mighty
forest and in a twinkling were out of sight again.
Then all became as quiet as before.</p>

<p>“Don’t hear any Indians,” was Joe Winship’s
comment, after straining his ears for a full
minute. “And lost a tremendously good shot,”
he added regretfully.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s best to be on the safe side. If half
a dozen redskins were after those deer we
wouldn’t stand any show at all against ’em,” said
Harry Parsons, with a decided shake of his curly-haired
head. “You remember what our folks
told us—to keep out of trouble.”</p>

<p>“But what beautiful deer they were!”</p>

<p>“You are right. And it isn’t likely they’ll come
back this way——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>“Hush!”</p>

<p>As Joe Winship uttered the word he caught
his companion by the sleeve and pointed through
the forest to where there was an opening, perhaps
an acre in extent, dotted here and there with small
brushwood.</p>

<p>“What did you see, Joe?”</p>

<p>“A couple of Indians. There they are again—getting
ready to cross the brook!”</p>

<p>“They came up quietly enough. What shall
we do?”</p>

<p>“Let us get behind yonder bushes. They are
on the trail of the game, and I don’t think they’ll
come this way. But if they do we’ll have trouble
just as sure as you are born,” concluded Joe
Winship, and led the way to the shelter he had
mentioned, quickly followed by his companion.</p>

<p>Joe Winship was a youth of fifteen, tall and as
strong as outdoor life can make a boy of that age.
He was the only son of Ezra Winship, a hardy
hunter and pioneer, one of the number who did
so much to build up our country in years gone by.
Besides Joe, the family consisted of the boy’s
mother and his two sisters, named respectively
Cora and Harmony, both of whom were younger
than himself.</p>

<p>Harry Parsons was a few months older than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Joe. He too was an only son, and had one sister,
Clara, two years older than himself. His father,
Peter, had in years gone by been a cattle dealer
doing business in and around Philadelphia, and
had there married his wife, Polly, of Quaker
stock.</p>

<p>It was during a visit to Williamsburgh that
Mr. Peter Parsons had fallen in with Ezra Winship,
about four years previous to the opening of
this story. A chance acquaintanceship had
ripened into true friendship, which speedily
spread from all the members of one family to all
the members of the other.</p>

<p>From Williamsburgh the Winships and the
Parsons migrated to a small settlement in North
Carolina known by the name of Jackson’s Ford.
Here log cabins were built and some planting was
done by the boys and the others, while Mr. Winship
and Mr. Parsons spent a good deal of their
time in bringing down game in the almost trackless
forests to the west of the rude settlement—the
game being used to supply the table with meat
and the pelts being sold or traded for household
commodities at a trading-post thirty-five miles
away.</p>

<p>In those days—just previous to the Revolution
of 1776—the great West was an unknown country
to the American colonists. There were settlements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
in plenty along the Atlantic seacoasts, and
for several hundreds of miles inland, but beyond
this was, to them, the trackless forests and the unknown
mountains, inhabited by game of all sorts
and Indians.</p>

<p>One of the leading pioneers of those times, and
one who will figure quite largely in our story, was
Daniel Boone. Boone had already gone into the
wilderness beyond the Kentucky River, and had
come back to tell of the richness of the land there
and the abundance of game. As a result a company
was formed to settle the territory now
known as the State of Kentucky, and among the
first of the pioneers to take part in this move
westward was Peter Parsons, who helped to erect
a fort at what was afterwards called Boonesborough.</p>

<p>The settlement at Boonesborough was quickly
followed by other settlements at Harrodsburgh,
Boiling Spring, and St. Asaph, and when it became
an assured fact that Kentucky was to be
settled and held by the bold pioneers who had followed
in the footsteps of Daniel Boone, Peter
Parsons sent back word to Jackson’s Ford asking
Ezra Winship to join him in this “far western
country,” and bring all the members of the
two families with him. He stated that he had
selected two fine grants of land upon which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
could build, and that upon his arrival Mr. Winship
should have his pick of the two prospective
farms.</p>

<p>In those days to move, especially with one’s
household effects, was no easy matter, and it was
a good two months before all was in readiness
for the start. The Winship and the Parsons
family did not go alone, but were accompanied
by four other pioneers and their families and a
pack train of fourteen horses, for to get anything
like a wagon or cart through the wilderness was
utterly impossible.</p>

<p>To the boys the move westward seemed to
promise no end of sport, and they willingly did
all they could to further the project. But the girls
and their mothers dreaded to think of this step
into the great wilderness, and Mrs. Parsons shook
her head doubtfully as she said in her quaint
Quaker way:</p>

<p>“Friend Ezra, since Peter wishes me to come
to him, I will go with thee. But I am of a mind
that our journey will be a troublous one, and that
the Indians will not be as friendly as thee imagines.”</p>

<p>“Have no fear, Mistress Parsons, but that we
will get through in safety,” answered Ezra Winship.
“The trail has now been used half a score
of times, so we cannot very well get lost, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
for the Indians, if we do not harm them I doubt
if they harm us.”</p>

<p>But even though he spoke thus, Ezra Winship
knew that all who were to move westward with
him were sure to encounter more or less of peril.
Wild animals roamed the forest, and the Indians,
although apparently friendly, were not to be
trusted. To this were to be added the perils of
storms and of forest fires, and the dangers of
crossing rapidly flowing streams in such frail
craft as they could build, or upon horseback.</p>

<p>All told, there were five men and six boys in
the train that started out from Jackson’s Ford one
warm and pleasant day. Before the exodus began
Ezra Winship called the men and the older
boys aside and gave them a little advice.</p>

<p>“We are moving into a strange territory,” he
said. “There is no telling what perils we may
have to face. You have made me your leader,
and that being so, I feel it my duty to warn each
one to be on his guard constantly. In traveling,
always be sure to keep the rest of our train in
sight, and never discharge your weapons without
reloading immediately. If any Indians appear,
treat them well so long as they are friendly, but
do not trust them too far.”</p>

<p>The progress westward was slow, but twelve
miles being covered the first day, fifteen the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
second, and ten the third. The trail—a narrow
path used occasionally by the buffalo and by the
Indians—was an exceedingly rough one, winding
in and out of the forest and along the banks of
rivers and small streams. At certain spots were
huge rocks, over which buffalo and Indians could
scramble with ease, but around which the pack
horses had to make their way slowly and cautiously.</p>

<p>The party were out a week before any Indians
appeared. Then one of the pioneers announced
that he had discovered three red men looking
down upon them from a nearby cliff.</p>

<p>“They disappeared the minute I spotted ’em,”
said the pioneer, whose name was Pepperill Frost,
generally shortened to Pep Frost.</p>

<p>“We must be on our guard against them,” said
Ezra Winship, and that night a strict guard was
kept, but no red men appeared.</p>

<p>But the next afternoon, about three o’clock,
four Indians showed themselves at a spot where
the trail crossed a shallow, rocky brook. They
came up with their hands before them and with
their bows and arrows and other weapons slung
over their backs.</p>

<p>“To what place journey our white brothers?”
questioned one of the Indians, after the usual
greeting in his native tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“To some place where they can live in peace
with our red brethren,” answered Ezra Winship
cautiously.</p>

<p>After this the Indians said little, but begged
for some tobacco and some Indian meal, a small
quantity of which was given to them. They then
departed into the forest, disappearing as rapidly
as they had come.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll see more of those Indians,” said
Pep Frost.</p>

<p>“I believe you,” answered Ezra Winship.
“And perhaps they’ll not be so friendly another
time. But do not alarm the women folks, for it
will do no good.”</p>

<p>Early the following morning an accident happened
which came close to proving fatal to one of
the boys, Chet Rockley by name. He was driving
a pack horse loaded with provisions along the
river bank when the horse slipped and fell into the
stream, carrying the lad with him. In the
struggle that followed the boy was kicked in the
head by the animal. Chet Rockley was rescued
by Ezra Winship, but the horse was carried away
by the swift current and drowned, and the provisions
were lost.</p>

<p>It was decided to rest for two days, to care for
young Rockley, and to bring in some game to
take the place of the provisions which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
lost. A temporary camp was established at the
fork of two small streams, and as soon as this
was done the men folks and the boys took turns
in going out hunting and fishing.</p>

<p>Joe and Harry had been cautioned not to go too
far, and to keep a close watch for Indians. But
their anxiety to bring in at least one good-sized
deer had caused them to roam further from the
camp than at first anticipated. They had seen
no game until the four deer burst into view,
closely followed by the two Indians already mentioned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>PURSUED BY THE INDIANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Do</span> you really think the Indians would prove
unfriendly?” questioned Harry, as both boys
crouched down behind a thick clump of bushes.</p>

<p>“I do—if they belong to the crowd who called
upon us yesterday. There was one Indian in
particular, a tall chap, who looked bloodthirsty
enough for anything,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“You mean the fellow called Long Knife?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t deny he did look ugly, Joe. But then
a redskin can’t help his looks.”</p>

<p>Here the talk came to a sudden end, for a
splashing in the brook reached their ears, telling
that the two Indians were not far away. They
had not gone after the deer as the boys had imagined,
but were coming closer. Harry clutched
Joe’s arm, and both youths crouched lower than
ever in the grass and brushwood.</p>

<p>In a minute more the two red men were less
than a rod away, and the boys could hear them
talking softly to one another. Peeping through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the bushes, Joe made out the savage face of Long
Knife, and saw that the Indian carried a musket
of ancient pattern, and a horn of powder and ball,
as well as his bow and arrows, and his tomahawk.
The second Indian was similarly armed.</p>

<p>Hardly daring to breathe, the boys remained
behind the bushes until the Indians had passed the
spot and followed the course of the stream a distance
of several rods further. Then Harry
touched Joe on the arm.</p>

<p>“Did you see it?” he asked, in a low voice, but
one full of suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>“See what, Harry?”</p>

<p>“The scalp Long Knife carried. I’m sure it
was a fresh one, too!”</p>

<p>“A fresh scalp! Oh, Harry, are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the best thing we can do is to get
back to the train without delay.”</p>

<p>“But the Indians have gone up the brook——”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to take to the forest and trust to
luck.”</p>

<p>“Supposing they have attacked the train?
That scalp may be that of one of our party!”</p>

<p>“Let us trust not,” answered Harry, but with
a face that showed his anxiety.</p>

<p>The youths had been following the course of
the brook, which was lined on one bank with a
series of large flat rocks. On these rocks their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
trail had been lost, so that the Indians had not
discovered their footprints in the semi-gloom
caused by the heavy forest growth overhead.</p>

<p>“But they’ll find some footprints before long,”
said Joe, in speaking of this. “And when they do
they may be after us hot-footed.”</p>

<p>Fortunately for the boys the brook, as they remembered,
made a long semicircle, so that if they
could make their way through the forest in anything
of a straight line they would cut off a
goodly portion of the distance to camp.</p>

<p>The gun of each was loaded and freshly primed,
and each held his weapon ready for instant use
should occasion require. Joe led the way, but
Harry followed closely in his footsteps.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred yards had been covered
when there came a shot from a distance, followed
by several others.</p>

<p>“Where can they come from?” questioned Joe.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we are in sound of the camp,
Joe. But if we are, perhaps those other shots
came from there, too.”</p>

<p>“No, they were off in that direction.” Joe
pointed with his hand. “I can tell you what, I
don’t like the looks of the situation, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t—and that is why I think we had
best get back to camp with all speed.”</p>

<p>On and on they went, deeper and deeper into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the forest. The summer day was drawing to a
close and they knew that in another hour the
darkness of night would be upon them.</p>

<p>Suddenly a small wild animal darted up in
their path. This caused Joe to fall back upon
Harry, and by accident the latter’s gun was discharged,
the buckshot whistling past Joe’s left ear
and tearing through the boughs overhead.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe, are you shot?” cried Harry in keen
alarm.</p>

<p>“I—I reckon not,” stammered his companion,
as soon as he could recover from the shock.
“But why did you fire over my shoulder like that?
It was only a jack-rabbit.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to fire. The gun—hark!”</p>

<p>Harry stopped short and both listened. From
a distance they could hear one Indian calling
to another. Then followed a crashing through
some undergrowth.</p>

<p>“They are after us sure!” ejaculated Harry.
“Come on.”</p>

<p>Both broke into a run without waiting for
Harry to reload. As they went on, they heard
more firing at a distance, and then a long yell that
they knew could mean but one thing.</p>

<p>“The Indians are on the warpath!” exclaimed
Joe. “There can be no doubt of it—they have
attacked the camp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“How many do you suppose there are of
them?”</p>

<p>“There is no telling. But if they number a
dozen or more it will surely go hard with all of
our party, Harry.”</p>

<p>They calculated that they had covered half the
distance to the camp when they reached something
of a hollow. Here the undergrowth was
extra heavy and the ground wet and uncertain,
and before they realized it they were in a bog up
to their ankles.</p>

<p>“This won’t do,” came from Harry. “If we
aren’t careful we’ll get in so deep we can’t get out
again. We’ll have to turn back.”</p>

<p>“Turn back—with the Indians following us?”
said Joe.</p>

<p>“I mean to walk around this hollow, Joe.
It’s the only way.”</p>

<p>They turned back to dry ground and then
moved to the southward, still further away from
the brook. Here was something of an opening,
but they avoided this and made for some rocks,
gaining a new shelter just as three Indians burst
into view.</p>

<p>“Keep to the rocks,” whispered Joe. “Don’t
leave a trail if you can help it—and get away as
far as possible from this place!”</p>

<p>He went on, over the rocks, and Harry followed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
The way led deeper and deeper into the
forest and soon the light of day was shut out entirely.</p>

<p>Both were now out of breath and glad enough
to climb into a dense tree and rest. As they sat
among the upper branches they listened intently
for more signs of the Indians, but none reached
them. Once Joe fancied he heard a cry in English
at a great distance, but he was not certain.</p>

<p>“This is a pickle truly,” observed Harry, after
a long spell of silence.</p>

<p>“It is what we get for straying away too far
from camp,” returned Joe bitterly. “Father
warned me to keep near, and he warned everybody
else, too.”</p>

<p>“What do you say we should do next?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know, Harry. If we start to go on
those Indians may be laying low for us.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to remain in the tree all night?”</p>

<p>“We may have to remain here all night. If
we start out after it is real dark we may become
hopelessly lost in the timber.”</p>

<p>“But the redskins can spot us twice as quick
in the daylight as they can now.”</p>

<p>“I know that as well as you.”</p>

<p>After this came another long spell of silence, in
which each boy was busy with his thoughts. The
mind of each dwelt upon the camp. Had it been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
attacked, and if so had any of the loved ones been
slain?</p>

<p>As night came on they heard strange sounds in
the forest, sounds which would have frightened
youths less used to woodcraft. From the hollow
came the mournful glunk of frogs, and the shrill
tweet of tree toads. All around them the night
birds uttered their solitary notes, punctuated ever
and anon with the hoot of an owl. And then they
heard the rustling of underbrush as various wild
animals stole from their lairs in quest of prey.</p>

<p>“I am going to climb to the top of the tree and
see if I can locate the camp-fire,” said Harry, at
length. “If that is burning as usual it will be a
sign that nothing very wrong has happened.”</p>

<p>Leaving his gun hanging on a limb, he commenced
to climb from one branch to the next.
Joe was about to follow but concluded that it
would be best for one to remain below on guard,
for the top of this giant of the forest was fully
eighty feet above the position he now occupied.</p>

<p>The climbing of such a tree is by no means an
easy task. As Harry approached the top he found
the branches further apart and quite slender, and
he had all he could do to haul himself from one
safe position to another above it.</p>

<p>His activity was rewarded at last, and he stood
on a limb which gave him a free and uninterrupted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
view of the country for miles around.
There was no moon, but the sky was clear, and
countless stars served to brighten the early night.
Far to the westward the clouds were still red from
the setting sun.</p>

<p>Eagerly the youth turned to where he imagined
the camp-fire of the pioneers must be located. Not
a single light came to view, either camp-fire or
lantern.</p>

<p>“That is certainly queer,” he told himself.
“Not a flare of any kind.”</p>

<p>The thought had scarcely crossed his mind
when his attention was attracted to a location
about half a mile to the northward of the camp.
The light of a torch had blazed forth and was
now revolving rapidly in a semicircle.</p>

<p>“An Indian signal,” he muttered softly. “I
wish I knew what it meant.”</p>

<p>The light was waved in a semicircle for fully
half a minute. Then it bobbed up and down
twice and vanished.</p>

<p>Scarcely had this light gone from view than
Harry noticed another light, this time on the
other side of the pioneers’ camp. This new light
was bobbing up and down at a rapid rate, making
it look almost like a streak of fire. Then it
changed from side to side, and then to a circle.
Inside of three minutes it was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“If one could only read the Indian signs it
might prove a big help,” mused the boy. “Perhaps
I had better stay up here to-night and see if
any more signs are made. Then, if we get back
to camp in the morning, I can ask old Pep Frost
what they mean.”</p>

<p>He sat in a crotch of the limb for the best part
of half an hour. The position was far from comfortable,
and he was on the point of changing it
when he heard a noise some distance below.</p>

<p>“Is that you coming up, Joe?” he asked softly.</p>

<p>A low hiss of warning was the only reply, and
Harry knew at once something was wrong. He
leaned far down and presently made out his companion,
coming up slowly and noiselessly and carrying
both of the guns.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked, when he could get his
mouth close to Joe’s ear.</p>

<p>“Three Indians are in the forest, close to the
bottom of this tree,” was the answer. “Don’t
make a sound or we’ll be discovered—if we
haven’t been spotted already.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>A DISMAYING DISCOVERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> announcement that Joe Winship made
filled Harry Parsons with renewed fear. The
three Indians in the forest below them must surely
be on their trail, and for no good purpose.</p>

<p>In a low whisper Harry related what he had
seen, and Joe agreed that they were Indian signals.</p>

<p>“More than likely they are surrounding the
camp,” whispered Joe. “And as you didn’t see
the camp-fire likely the folks are on guard. They
are not going to make a light for the redskins to
shoot by.”</p>

<p>This was all that was said for a long time. Joe
passed up his companion’s gun and both sat in
readiness to defend their lives at any instant it
might become necessary to do so.</p>

<p>Presently the low murmur of voices came to
their ears from the very root of the tree in which
they were in hiding. Two Indians had met there
and were discussing the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“What are they saying?” whispered Harry,
for he knew that Joe had learned considerable of
the Indian tongue, both from some friendly red
men and from his father.</p>

<p>“I can’t hear clearly,” replied Joe. “I might
go down a little further.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it—it isn’t safe,” was his companion’s
warning.</p>

<p>But Joe was curious, and as the murmur of
voices continued, he noiselessly lowered himself
until he was halfway down to the roots of the
monarch of the forest.</p>

<p>Leaning over a limb, he strained his ears to
catch what was said. The dialect of the red men
was somewhat new to him, yet he caught the
words “camp of the palefaces,” “Long Knife
has commanded it,” and a little later “his scalp
shall be mine.”</p>

<p>It was a good half-hour before the Indians
moved away, having been joined by three others.
All were in warpaint, as Joe could see by a smoky
torch which one of the number carried. Luckily
the Indians had tramped around the bottom of the
tree so much that the trail of the two youths was
completely obliterated.</p>

<p>When Joe returned to where he had left Harry,
the pair discussed the situation in an earnest
whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“The whole thing is clear in my mind,” said
Joe. “Long Knife has ordered a raid on our
camp, and one of the redskins has a particular
grudge against one of our crowd and is going in
to get his scalp. The question is: what are we to
do?”</p>

<p>“What can we do, Joe?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what we can do, Harry, but I
know what we ought to try to do.”</p>

<p>“Get back to camp and warn everybody?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Of course I think they are on guard
already, but we are not sure of it. And if the redskins
fall on them by surprise they’ll kill all of the
men folks, and kill the women and children too,
or carry them off.”</p>

<p>“Then let us try to get back to camp, no matter
how perilous it is.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing.”</p>

<p>It was not long after this that they were on
the lowest branch of the tree. They strained eyes
and ears for some sign of the Indians, but none
appeared. Joe was the first to drop to the
ground, and Harry speedily followed.</p>

<p>From the top of the tree they had “located
themselves” with care, and now they struck out
in the darkness directly for the camp.</p>

<p>“We are taking our lives in our hands,” was
the way in which Joe expressed himself. “But it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
cannot be helped. I don’t want to see the others
suffer if we can do anything that will save
them.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Joe,” was his companion’s reply.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the boys there was but little
undergrowth in that portion of the great forest,
and the ground was comparatively level. The
trees, five to fifteen feet apart, grew up tall and as
straight as so many arrows. Some had stood
there for many, many years, and it did not seem
possible that these veterans were later on to fall
beneath the stroke of the woodman’s ax, to make
way for the farmer and his crops.</p>

<p>But if brushwood was wanting, exposed roots
were not, and more than once one boy or the other
would go sprawling in the darkness.</p>

<p>“By George, what a fall!” panted Harry, after
a tumble that had laid him flat on his breast.
“It—it knocked the wind right out of me.”</p>

<p>“Be glad it didn’t knock out your teeth,” answered
Joe, as he assisted him to his feet. “It is
dark here for certain.”</p>

<p>“How far do you suppose we have still to
go?”</p>

<p>“Not less than half a mile.”</p>

<p>A moment after this a distant shot rang out,
followed by several others in quick succession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Then came a muffled yell, which gradually became
louder.</p>

<p>“The attack on the camp has begun!” ejaculated
Joe. “Oh, Harry, we are too late!”</p>

<p>“You are right. More than likely the camp is
surrounded.”</p>

<p>“Then we can’t get to the others even if we
try!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can. Anyway I am not going to
stay here when the others may be fighting for
their lives. Think of your mother and mine, and
of the girls.”</p>

<p>“Yes! yes!” Joe gave a groan which was
echoed by his companion. “We must go on.”</p>

<p>And on they did go, running as fast as the
trees and the darkness permitted. The land
sloped slightly upward, but this they did not
notice until Harry, who was slightly in advance,
gave a cry of alarm. Then followed a crash of
brushwood and a splash.</p>

<p>“Harry! Harry! what’s the matter?” asked
Joe, and came to a halt.</p>

<p>No answer came back, and filled with added
fear Joe crawled forward until he reached the
brushwood. Then of a sudden he took a step
backward. The brushwood was on the edge of a
cliff and in front was a sheer descent of fully
fifty feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“Harry went over that and most likely broke
his neck,” was Joe’s first thought, and a shiver
passed down his backbone. Then he remembered
having heard a faint splash, and crawling forward
on hands and knees, peered over the cliff into the
darkness beneath.</p>

<p>At first he could see nothing. But then came a
faint twinkling of stars as they were reflected in
the surface of the water, and he knew that a pond
or a stream lay at the bottom of the cliff.</p>

<p>“Harry! Harry!” he called out, first in an
ordinary tone and then louder and louder. For
the moment his own peril was forgotten in his
alarm over the disappearance of his chum.</p>

<p>No answering cry came back, and again Joe
shivered. What if his companion was drowned?</p>

<p>“I must get down to the bottom of the cliff,”
he told himself. “And the sooner the better.
Harry may not yet be dead.”</p>

<p>With extreme caution the young pioneer moved
along the edge of the cliff, not leaving one footing
until he was sure of the next. By this means
he discovered something of a break, and here let
himself down, foot by foot. The route was rough,
and more than once he scratched his face and
hands, but just then he gave no attention to the
hurts.</p>

<p>Luckily for Joe there was at the foot of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
cliff a small stretch of rocks and sand less than a
yard wide. Standing on this the youth surveyed
the surface of the dark water before him with interest.</p>

<p>It was no pond to which he had descended, but
a good-sized stream which flowed rapidly to the
northward, being hedged in on one side by the
cliff, and on the other by a rock-bound forest.
The stream disappeared around a curve of the
cliff.</p>

<p>A rapid search along the sandy shore under the
cliff revealed nothing more than Harry’s rifle,
which had caught in a bush just over the water’s
edge. This gave Joe a clew to where his companion
had fallen, and he searched eagerly in the
water at that point.</p>

<p>“Not a sign,” he murmured after reaching into
the stream as far as possible. Then he cut down
a sapling with his hunting knife and stirred up the
water with that, and with no better result.</p>

<p>“The river is flowing so swiftly it must have
carried Harry’s body away,” he reasoned. “Perhaps
I had better move around the curve of the
cliff and make a search there.”</p>

<p>All this while Joe had heard distant firing and
yelling, and now, as he straightened up, he saw a
glow in the sky, as of a conflagration.</p>

<p>“Something is on fire,” he thought. “And it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
isn’t a plain camp-fire either. Oh, I trust to
Heaven that the others are safe!”</p>

<p>Slowly and painfully he crawled along at the
foot of the cliff until the bend was reached. Here
a footing was uncertain, and more than once he
slipped into the stream up to his ankles.</p>

<p>Around the bend the water swirled and foamed,
on its way to a series of rough rocks. Here was
another cliff and the stream appeared to disappear
beneath this, much to Joe’s wonder.</p>

<p>“If it’s an underground river good-by to poor
Harry,” he told himself.</p>

<p>Again he called out, not once, but a score of
times, and the only answer he received was an
echo from the rocks.</p>

<p>“Poor, poor Harry!” he murmured, and the
tears of sorrow stood in his eyes. He loved his
chum as though the two were brothers.</p>

<p>Joe knew not how to proceed. He wanted to
find Harry, and he also wanted to learn how his
folks and the others were faring at the camp.</p>

<p>While he was meditating he saw the flare of a
torch on the opposite side of the stream. He had
just time enough to drop behind an outstanding
rock when three Indians came into view. Each
carried a bundle, but what the loads contained
Joe could not tell.</p>

<p>From a hiding place beneath the trees the Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
brought forth a large canoe and two
paddles. They placed their loads into the craft,
and then entered themselves.</p>

<p>“Can they be coming over here?” Joe asked
himself.</p>

<p>The question was soon answered in the negative,
for the Indians turned up the stream. It
was a difficult matter to paddle against the strong
current, but the red men were equal to the task,
and soon the canoe disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager all I am worth those were things
stolen from our camp,” reasoned Joe.</p>

<p>He sat down at the water’s edge to listen and
to think. All had become quiet in the distance,
and the red glow in the sky was dying away.</p>

<p>“I must do something,” he cried, leaping up.
“If I stay here I’ll go crazy. Perhaps mother
and father and the others need me this very
minute.”</p>

<p>As quickly as he could he made his way along
the rocks to the point where the stream disappeared
under the cliff. Then he worked his way
around to where the Indians had launched their
canoe.</p>

<p>“There must be some sort of a route from this
point to our camp,” he told himself.</p>

<p>He was about to move onward through the
forest when another torch came into view. Again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
he ran for shelter, and was not an instant too soon.
Four red men were marching forward to the river,
and between each pair was a captive, disarmed,
and with his hands tied tightly behind him.</p>

<p>“Pep Frost!” murmured Joe, as he caught a
good look at the first of the captives. It was indeed
the pioneer the youth had mentioned. His
garb was torn and dirty, and his face streaked
with blood, showing that he had fought desperately.</p>

<p>The second captive was also dirty and bloodstained,
and walked with a limp, as if wounded in
the left leg. As he came closer Joe could scarcely
suppress a cry of horror.</p>

<p>“Father!” he gasped, and he was right. The
second captive was Ezra Winship.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>LOST UNDERGROUND</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh!</span>”</p>

<p>That was the single cry which Harry uttered
as he plunged over the edge of the cliff into the
stream below.</p>

<p>As he went down his gun was torn from his
grasp by the bushes, and an instant later he struck
the stream with a splash and went down straight
to the bottom.</p>

<p>The breath was knocked out of him by the fall,
and when he came again to the surface he was
more than half unconscious. He felt himself
borne along by the current, and there followed a
strange humming in his ears. Then his senses
completely forsook him.</p>

<p>When Harry was once more able to reason he
knew little outside of the fact that he had a severe
headache, and that all was pitch-dark around him.
He lay in a shallow pool with the swiftly flowing
river within an arm’s length. Absolute darkness
was on all sides of the youth.</p>

<p>For a long time he lay still, gasping for breath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and putting his hand feebly to his forehead.
Then he sat up and stared about in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Joe!” he stammered. “Joe!”</p>

<p>Of course there was no answer, and then Harry
slowly realized what had happened—his rapid run
through the forest, his coming to the cliff, and
his unexpected plunge into the river beneath.</p>

<p>“I’m still in the water,” he thought. “But
where?”</p>

<p>This question he could not answer, nor could
he explain to himself how it was that he had not
been drowned. But with even so much of peril
still around him he was thankful that his life had
been spared.</p>

<p>Feeling cautiously around the pool, he soon
learned which side sloped to the river, and which
toward a sandy underground shore, and slowly
and painfully he dragged himself up to the higher
ground.</p>

<p>“I am not at the cliff, that is certain,” he mused,
as he tried to gaze upward. “I can’t see a star.”</p>

<p>The conviction then forced itself upon him that
he was underground, and this being so he quickly
came to the conclusion that the flow of the river
had carried him to this locality. But how far he
was from the spot where he had taken the fall he
could not imagine.</p>

<p>He was too weak to travel, or even to make an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
examination of his surroundings, and having
moved around a distance of less than a rod along
the bank of the underground stream he was glad
enough to sink down again to rest.</p>

<p>As Harry sat there, his head still aching, his
mind went back to Joe.</p>

<p>“I suppose he thinks I am dead,” was his dismal
thought.</p>

<p>Slowly the time wore away and Harry sat in
something of a doze, too weak to either move or
speculate upon his condition, very much as one
does who is recovering from a long spell of sickness.</p>

<p>Thus the night wore away and morning came
to view outside, with clear warm sunshine and
singing birds. But in the cavern the darkness remained
as great as before.</p>

<p>At last Harry felt that he must do something
for himself. He was beginning to grow hungry,
and he knew that many hours had passed since he
had taken the plunge into the stream.</p>

<p>“I must see if I can’t follow the river back to
where it ran under the rocks,” was what he told
himself. “That ought o bring me back to the
cliff, and perhaps I’ll find Joe looking for
me.”</p>

<p>With extreme caution he felt of the water, to
find in what direction it was flowing, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
essayed to follow the stream up its course between
the rocks and along the sandy beach.</p>

<p>It was a difficult task, and more than once he
had to stop to get back his strength. At certain
points he had to climb rocks which were sharp
and slippery, and twice he fell into the stream and
pulled himself out only with much labor.</p>

<p>And then came the bitterest moment of all,
when he reached a point where the beach came to
an end and found that the opening further up the
stream was completely filled with water, which
roared onward, dashing the spray in all directions.
Here Harry could see a faint gleam of daylight,
but only sufficient to show him how completely he
was a prisoner.</p>

<p>“I can’t get through that,” he muttered. “If
I try it I’ll surely be drowned.”</p>

<p>But if he could not get through what was he
to do? To remain where he was would be to
starve like a rat in a trap.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the stream leaves this cave at the
other end,” he reasoned. “But that may be a
long way from here.”</p>

<p>There was no help for it, and with slow and
painful steps he retraced his way along the underground
river bank, often falling over the rough
rocks and stopping every few rods to rest and get
back his breath. He was now hungrier than ever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
and eagerly gnawed at a bit of birch wood which
he happened to pick up out of the water as he
moved along.</p>

<p>As Harry journeyed onward, he came to a
sharp turn of the stream. Here the water appeared
to divide into several parts, and two of
these sunk out of sight amid the rough rocks on
all sides. A small stream flowed to the left. From
some point far overhead a faint light shone down,
just sufficient to reveal the condition of affairs to
the youth.</p>

<p>“What a cave!” murmured Harry to himself,
and he was right. It was certainly a large opening,
but nothing at all in comparison to the great
Mammoth Cave of that territory, discovered
some years later, and which covers many miles of
ground. The roof was fully fifty feet above the
young pioneer’s head, and the walls were three or
four times that distance apart.</p>

<p>Having even a faint light made walking easier,
and once again he went onward, following the
single stream that remained in sight. Twice he
heard a rush of birds over his head, which made
him confident that the open air could not be far
off. The cave turned and twisted in several directions,
and at last he saw sunshine ahead and
fairly ran to make certain that he had not been
deceived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>When he was really out into the open air once
more, Harry sat down on the grass, trembling in
every limb. To him the time spent underground
seemed an age. Never before had the sun and
the blue vault of heaven appeared to him so
beautiful.</p>

<p>But it was not long before the pangs of hunger
again asserted themselves. He had already taken
note of some berry bushes, and he hobbled to
these and ate what he wanted of the fruit. They
stilled the gnawing in his stomach, but did not
satisfy him.</p>

<p>In his pocket the young pioneer had some fishing
lines and several hooks, and also a box with
flint and tinder. He laid the tinder out to dry on
a warm rock, and then with the line went to fishing,
after having turned up some worms from
under a number of small stones.</p>

<p>His catch of fish amounted to little, but soon he
had enough for a single meal, and then he made
himself a tiny fire. He could hardly wait to cook
the fish, and it must be confessed that he gulped
them down when still half raw,—for Harry’s appetite
had always been of the best, and in those
days pioneers did not dare to be over-particular
concerning their food.</p>

<p>By the position of the sun Harry judged that
it was nearly noon. As the orb of day was almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
directly overhead it was next to impossible for
him to locate the points of the compass.</p>

<p>“If I felt stronger I would climb a tree and
take a look around,” he told himself. But he was
still so shaky he felt that there would be too much
danger of falling.</p>

<p>A grassy bank close to where he had cooked the
fish looked very inviting, and he threw himself
upon it to rest—for just about ten minutes, so he
told himself. But the ten minutes lengthened
into twenty, and then into half an hour, and soon
he was sleeping soundly, poor, worn-out Nature
having at last claimed her own.</p>

<p>When Harry awoke he felt much refreshed,
and his headache was entirely gone. He sprang
to his feet with an exclamation of surprise, for
the sun was setting over the forest in the west.</p>

<p>“I must have slept all afternoon,” he murmured
ruefully. “Well, I reckon I needed it.
But I should have been on my way before dark.”</p>

<p>He now felt more like climbing a tree, and was
soon going up a tall walnut that stood on a slight
hill near by.</p>

<p>From the top a grand panorama of the rolling
hills of Kentucky was spread out before him—that
captivating scene which had but a few years
before so charmed Daniel Boone and other pioneers
who had entered that territory. Here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
there a stream glistened in the setting sun, and at
one point Harry could see an open stretch of grass
with a small herd of buffalo grazing peacefully,
while at another point, evidently a salt-lick,
several deer were making themselves at home. As
Daniel Boone had said, it was truly the land of
plenty.</p>

<p>But Harry’s mind was just then centered upon
but two things—to find Joe and to get back as
soon as possible to the camp,—provided anything
was left of the latter, which was questionable. As
he thought of the Indians he shook his head
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“They won’t give up this land to us if they can
help it,” he told himself. “They will fight for it
to the bitter end. For all I know to the contrary,
all of the others, including Joe, may be either dead
or prisoners.”</p>

<p>From his position in the tree Harry tried to
locate the camp which he had left the morning
before, but all he could see was a smoldering fire
far in the distance.</p>

<p>“That looks as if it might be where the camp
was,” he reasoned.</p>

<p>Descending to the ground once more he determined
to make his way in the direction of the
smoldering fire. Before setting out he cut himself
a stout club. He mourned the loss of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
gun, and wondered what he should do if confronted
by the Indians, or by some wild beast.</p>

<p>But the forest seemed deserted, and he passed
a good quarter of a mile without meeting anything
but a few rabbits and a fox, and these lost
no time in getting away.</p>

<p>The sun was already out of sight behind some
trees when he struck another brook, that upon
which the fated camp had been located. Here
he stopped for a drink, getting down on his hands
and knees for that purpose.</p>

<p>Having satisfied his thirst, Harry was on the
point of rising, when a noise behind him attracted
his attention. He whirled around, to discover a
big black bear moving on him with great deliberation.</p>

<p>“Hi! get back there!” he yelled and swung his
stick at the beast. He did not mean to throw the
object, but it slipped from his hand and, sailing
through the air, struck bruin fairly and squarely
on the nose.</p>

<p>At once the bear let out a snort of pain and then
an added snort of rage. His den was in that
vicinity, and, thinking the youth had come to invade
it, he arose on his hind legs and came for
Harry in a clumsy fashion.</p>

<p>There now remained but one thing for the
young pioneer to do, and this he did without stopping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
to regain the club. He started off on a run
up the brook.</p>

<p>The bear immediately dropped down on all
fours and came after him. Although totally unconscious
of it, Harry was running directly for
the bear’s den. This enraged the beast still more,
and he did what he could to close the gap between
the boy and himself.</p>

<p>The bear was almost on top of Harry when
the young pioneer came to a wide-spreading tree
with low-hanging branches. One of the branches
was within easy reach, and as quick as a flash the
youth swung himself up, just as bruin made a leap
for him. The bear caught him by the toe, but the
boy’s foot-covering gave way and the beast fell
back.</p>

<p>Harry lost no time in climbing higher up in the
tree. Then he made his way to the trunk, and,
hanging to one of the limbs, drew his hunting knife
and waited for the bear to climb up.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE ESCAPE OF THE CAPTIVES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the moment after making the discovery
that the two captives in the hands of the Indians,
were his father and Pep Frost, the old pioneer,
Joe Winship could scarcely believe the evidence
of his senses.</p>

<p>“Father!” he repeated hoarsely. “Father
and Pep Frost!”</p>

<p>The sound of his voice reached one of the Indians,
and the red man gazed around sharply. But
Joe was wise enough to drop out of sight behind
some brushes, and the Indian continued to move
on, doubtless thinking that it was merely the wind
that had reached his ears.</p>

<p>The two captives were marched down to the
river front, and here another canoe was brought
to light, similar to that used by the three Indians
who had gone off with the three bundles.</p>

<p>“Whar are ye a-going to take us?” Joe heard
old Pep Frost ask.</p>

<p>For answer one of the Indians raised his palm
and struck the pioneer across the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“No talk now,” he said laconically.</p>

<p>The two captives were forced into the canoe,
one being placed at the bow and one at the stern.
Then two of the Indians took up the paddles and
started up the stream, in the direction pursued by
the first canoe.</p>

<p>Joe watched the proceedings with interest, but
when the canoe began to disappear from sight his
heart sank within him.</p>

<p>“If I could only follow!” he thought.</p>

<p>But to run along the river bank and thus keep
the craft in sight was out of the question. The
Indians were experts at using the paddle, and the
shore of the stream was, as we already know,
rough and uncertain.</p>

<p>Suddenly the youth was seized with a new idea.
If there had been two canoes secreted in the bushes
why not perhaps a third?</p>

<p>“I’ll hunt around and see,” he muttered, and
began the search at once.</p>

<p>In a tiny cove he found just what he wanted,
a small canoe boasting of a single paddle. Without
hesitation he leaped into it, took up the paddle,
and pushed the craft out into the river.</p>

<p>Joe had spent many of his boyhood days on the
rivers near his home and could row and paddle
just as well as he could shoot and ride on horseback.
If it had but a single paddle, the craft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
was correspondingly light, and by working with
vigor he managed to keep the larger canoe within
easy distance, although being careful to keep out
of reach of the enemies he was following.</p>

<p>As he worked at the paddle his thoughts were
busy. What did the capture of his father and
Pep Frost mean? Was it possible that the fight
at the camp had ended in a general massacre of
the others? Such a dire happening was not an
impossibility. He remembered that only the
summer before the Indians had fallen upon one
Jack Flockley and his companions, six in number,
and murdered all but one young girl, who had
been carried off into captivity.</p>

<p>“I must save them if I possibly can,” he
reasoned. “I’ve got my hunting knife and my
gun, as well as this gun of Harry’s. They will
all come in handy if I can but cut their bonds.”</p>

<p>Fortunately for Joe the Indians kept their torch
burning, as a signal for those who had gone on
ahead. Two turns of the stream were passed
when they came in sight of another torch, waving
to and fro on the left bank of the river. At once
the canoe turned in that direction, and presently
a landing was made at a point where those in the
first canoe had gone ashore.</p>

<p>By the light of the two torches Joe saw all of
the Indians assembled, with their captives and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
their bundles between them. He allowed his
own little canoe to drift past the landing and then
came ashore in the midst of some brushwood overhanging
the stream.</p>

<p>By making a détour the young pioneer presently
came to the rear of the enemy. He found that
they were going into something of a camp and
that they had already tied the two captives to
separate trees some eight or ten feet apart. Between
the two trees squatted a young warrior,
placed on guard over the whites.</p>

<p>Scarcely daring to breathe, Joe crept closer and
closer until he was less than five yards away from
where his father stood, hands and feet fastened
to the tree by means of a stout grass rope. For
the present he did not dare go closer, but, lying
full length in the grass, watched the Indians as
a hawk watches a brood of chickens.</p>

<p>The red men were much interested in the contents
of the bundles brought hither in the first
canoe. Torches were stuck up in convenient
places and the bundles were unrolled, revealing to
Joe many of the smaller articles which the pioneers
had been bringing westward on their pack horses.
There was a dress belonging to his mother, a pair
of slippers belonging to his sister Harmony, and
a razor that he knew belonged to his father. The
sight of the razor tickled the fancy of one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Indians, and flourishing it in the air he approached
Pep Frost and made a motion as if to cut the
throat of the old pioneer.</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon ye air ekel to it,” snorted Pep
Frost. “You are a cowardly, miserable lot at
the best!”</p>

<p>There was a small mirror in one of the bundles,
and this pleased the red men more than did any
other object. Running up to a torch, one after
another would gaze into the mirror with expressions
of wonder and admiration. Even the young
warrior on guard wanted to look into the glass.</p>

<p>For the moment the prisoners were forgotten
and, struck with a sudden determination, Joe
crawled close up behind his father and cut the
grass rope that bound the parent. Then he
placed one of the guns into Mr. Winship’s hand.</p>

<p>“It is I, Joe,” whispered the boy. “Wait till
I free Pep Frost.”</p>

<p>“Be quick, and be careful,” returned the astonished
man in an equally low tone. And he
added: “Are you alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>No more was said, and crawling backward Joe
made his way to the tree to which Pep Frost was
fastened. Two slashes of the knife and the old
pioneer was also liberated, and Joe provided him
with the second musket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Cut tudder man loose,” whispered Frost, as
he fingered the gun nervously.</p>

<p>“He is free,” answered Joe.</p>

<p>So far the captives had not moved from their
positions against the trees, and as the young warrior
looked at them he imagined each as secure
as ever. The Indians in general continued to
look over the contents of the bundles until a light
on the river caused a fresh interruption.</p>

<p>A third canoe was approaching filled with Indians
and with at least two captives. The latter
were evidently females, and one, a girl of twelve
or fifteen, was crying piteously.</p>

<p>“Let me go! Please let me go!” she begged.
“Oh, where are you taking me?”</p>

<p>“Better be quiet, Harmony,” said the woman
in the canoe. “It will do thee no good to
weep.”</p>

<p>“Harmony!” groaned Joe. “Harmony and
Mrs. Parsons! Where can sister Cora be, and
Harry’s sister Clara?”</p>

<p>All of the Indians had turned to the river front,
and now Pep Frost made a motion to Ezra Winship.
The pioneer understood, and, like a flash,
both turned and fled into the forest, calling softly
to Joe to follow.</p>

<p>Before the Indians discovered their loss the
former captives were a good hundred yards away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
They kept close together and Joe was by his
father’s side. Presently a mad yell rent the
air.</p>

<p>“They’ve found out the trick,” came from Pep
Frost. “But I reckon as how we’ve got the
best o’ ’em, Joey—and thanks to your slickness.”</p>

<p>“Did you see those in the canoe?” queried the
youth. “Mrs. Parsons and Harmony!”</p>

<p>“Harmony!” ejaculated Mr. Winship, and
stopped short. “Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father; Mrs. Parsons called her by
name.”</p>

<p>“Then I had best go back——”</p>

<p>“No, no!” put in Pep Frost. “It would be
worse nor suicide, friend Winship.”</p>

<p>“But my daughter—the redskins will——”</p>

<p>“I know, I know! But we must bide our
time,” interrupted Pep Frost again. “Remember,
there were seven redskins on shore and at
least four more on the river. We can’t fight no
sech band as thet.”</p>

<p>They had reached a small brook, and along this
Pep Frost forced the father and son, more than
half against their will. Yet both realized that
the old pioneer was right—that to fight eleven of
the foe under present circumstances would be out
of the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>The Indians were already on the trail and the
whites could hear them rushing along the tracks
left in the forest. At the brook they came to a
halt and then the force divided, some going up
the stream and some down.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t walk much further,” came presently
from Ezra Winship.</p>

<p>“By gum! I forgot about that wound in your
leg,” exclaimed Pep Frost; “but we air a-comin’
to some rocks now an’ more’n likely they’ll afford
us some kind o’ a hidin’-place.”</p>

<p>The old pioneer was right, and leaving the
brook they crawled up a series of rough rocks and
then into a hollow thick with brushwood. Here
they felt comparatively safe, and Ezra Winship
sank down exhausted, unable to take another
step.</p>

<p>While Pep Frost remained on guard to give
the alarm should any of the Indians appear in the
vicinity, Mr. Winship gave Joe some of the
particulars of the attack on the camp of the
pioneers.</p>

<p>“We were caught at something of a disadvantage,”
said he. “The horses were giving us a
good deal of trouble because one of them stepped
into a nest of hornets. While the men were trying
to calm the beasts the Indians rushed at us
without warning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Was anybody killed?”</p>

<p>“Yes; at the first volley Jim Vedder was laid
low and Jerry Dillsworth received a wound from
which he cannot possibly recover. The Freemans’
baby was also struck in the shoulder while her
mother was holding her in her arms. Those who
weren’t struck ran for their guns, and we fought
the redskins for fully quarter of an hour. But at
last the tide of battle went against us, and I was
laid low with an arrow wound in the thigh. I
went down and a horse came down on top of me,
and that was all I knew for about half an hour,
when I found myself a prisoner and tied to a tree
in the dark.”</p>

<p>“And mother and the girls——”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see anything more of them,” answered
Ezra Winship sadly. “I know your
mother was hit in the arm by a tomahawk, but
I don’t believe the wound was very bad. The
last I saw of Pep Frost he was fighting to save
Clara Parsons from being carried away. But a
blow from a club one of the redskins carried
stretched him flat, and when I saw him again he
was a prisoner like myself.”</p>

<p>“And what of all of the others, father?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say anything about them for certain,
but I imagine about half of them escaped under
cover of the darkness, and Pep Frost thinks that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
at least two men and two women got away on
horseback. Besides that, Frank Ludgate was off
on a hunt when the attack began, so that it is
very likely he escaped too,” concluded Ezra
Winship.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>HARRY AND THE BEAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunting knife</span> in hand, Harry waited for
the black bear to mount the tree after him. He
knew that if the beast came up he would have the
bear at a disadvantage, and he hoped that one
good stroke of the long blade would finish the
fight.</p>

<p>But the bear did not come up. Instead he
halted at the trunk, put his forepaws on the bark,
and gazed thoughtfully upward. Then he
dropped on his haunches, let out a growl of anger,
and sat where he was.</p>

<p>“Don’t want to fight, eh?” mused Harry.
“All right, but I hope you won’t stay where you
are too long.”</p>

<p>For a while the bear kept his eyes fixed on
Harry, as though expecting an attack. But as
this did not come bruin lay down at the foot of
the tree, resting his head on his forepaws.</p>

<p>This was certainly provoking, for it now looked
as if the beast meant to keep the young pioneer
a prisoner in the tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Perhaps he thinks he can starve me out,”
thought Harry. “Well, I reckon he can, if he
keeps me up here long enough. But I don’t
mean to stay—not if I can help myself.”</p>

<p>With the hunting knife Harry cut a small limb
from the tree and dropped it down on the bear.
With a snarl bruin snapped at the limb and buried
his teeth into it. Then he leaped up and began
to come up the tree in a clumsy fashion.</p>

<p>Harry’s heart thumped madly, for he knew
that a perilous moment was at hand. Grasping
the hunting knife firmly he leaned far down to
meet the oncoming animal.</p>

<p>Bruin was suspicious and evidently did not like
the looks of that gleaming blade. When still a
yard out of reach he halted in a crotch and snarled
viciously. Then he came closer inch by inch.</p>

<p>Leaning still further down Harry made a lunge
at the bear. Like a flash up came a forepaw to
ward off the blow. Paw and blade met and the
bear dropped back a little with the blood dripping
from his toes.</p>

<p>But the animal was not yet beaten, and soon he
came forward once more, uttering a suppressed
snarl and showing his gleaming teeth. He kept
his body low down as though meditating a spring.</p>

<p>It came and Harry met it with the point of the
hunting knife, which sank deeply into the bear’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
right eye. This was a telling blow and the beast
let a loud cry of pain. Then the bear dropped
back, limb by limb, to the ground.</p>

<p>“That was a lucky stroke,” thought the youth,
and he was right. He listened intently and soon
heard the bear crashing through the forest and
then climbing some rocks leading to his den.
With the sight of one eye gone all the fight had
been knocked out of him.</p>

<p>Not to be taken unawares, Harry descended to
the ground cautiously. But the coast was now
clear, and drops of blood on the grass and rocks
told plainly in what direction the beast had retreated.
Not wishing for another encounter
without a gun, the young pioneer moved away in
the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“Harry!”</p>

<p>The cry came from the rocks close at hand and
made the young pioneer leap in amazement.
Looking in the direction he saw Joe standing
there, backed up by Mr. Winship and Pep
Frost.</p>

<p>“Joe!” he ejaculated, and ran toward his
chum.</p>

<p>“Oh, how glad I am to know that you escaped!”
exclaimed Joe when they were together.
“I thought you were drowned surely.”</p>

<p>“I had a narrow escape,” was the answer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
“But where have you been, and what brings your
father and Pep Frost here?”</p>

<p>In the next few minutes each youth told his
story, to which the other listened with interest.</p>

<p>“You were lucky to escape from that cave,”
said Mr. Winship to Harry. “I have heard of
such places before but have never seen one.”</p>

<p>From Joe, Harry learned that his chum and the
others had been in hiding among the rocks and
trees all night and a part of the forenoon, not
being able to leave the vicinity because of Mr.
Winship’s wounded leg. The Indians had
scouted around for them for hours, but without
locating them, and they had slipped away to the
present location less than half an hour before.</p>

<p>“I must say I am mighty hungry,” said Pep
Frost. “An’ if ye don’t mind I’ll follow up thet
air b’ar Harry wounded an’ finish him an’ git the
meat.”</p>

<p>The others did not object, and the old pioneer
was soon on the trail of blood-spots.</p>

<p>“So my mother is in the hands of the Indians,”
said Harry, when this news was at last broken to
him. “Oh, Mr. Winship, this is terrible! And
your daughter Harmony, too! What shall we
do?”</p>

<p>“I am going on the trail of the redskins as
soon as my wound will permit, Harry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“And I am going along,” put in Joe.</p>

<p>“Then I shall go too. I wish we had two
more guns.”</p>

<p>In less than an hour Pep Frost came back,
bringing with him quite a large chunk of bear
meat.</p>

<p>“Had a putty good fight with thet b’ar,” he
said. “But the knocked-out eye bothered him a
good bit. I knocked out tudder with the gun an’
then the rest was easy.”</p>

<p>In a deep hollow among the rocks a fire was
kindled and here they broiled as much of the meat
as they cared to eat. This meal was welcome to
all and after it was over even Mr. Winship declared
that he felt like a new person.</p>

<p>The want of weapons was a serious one, and
Pep Frost declared that it was no use going
after the Indians unless the two boys were armed
with something. He cut for each a strong stick
and fashioned it into a bow, and then cut a dozen
or more arrows.</p>

<p>“Now try them,” he declared, and when they
did so, and found the arrows went fairly straight
and with good force, he was delighted.</p>

<p>“’Taint so good as a gun or a pistol,” he said,
“but it’s a heap sight better’n nuthin’.”</p>

<p>As some of the Indians had been wounded and
killed in the fight, the old pioneer declared that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
the red men would most likely remain in that
vicinity for a week or perhaps even for a
month.</p>

<p>“They know well enough that there aint nobuddy
to come to our aid,” he said. “So they’ll
hang around down by the river an’ give the
wounded warriors a chance to patch up thar
hurts.”</p>

<p>“And what will they do with their prisoners?”
questioned Harry.</p>

<p>“Keep ’em with ’em, more’n likely, lad.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we rescue them in the dark?” asked
Joe.</p>

<p>“Jest what I calkerlated we might try to do.
But we must be keerful, or else we’ll be killed,
an’ nobuddy saved nuther.”</p>

<p>It was late that evening when they started back
for the river, Pep Frost leading the way, slowly
and cautiously, with Harry’s gun still in hand,
ready to be used on an instant’s notice.</p>

<p>The boys had been taught the value of silence,
and the whole party proceeded in Indian file,
speaking only when it was necessary, and then in
nothing above a whisper.</p>

<p>It soon became evident that the clear night of
the day before was not to be duplicated. There
was a strong breeze blowing, and heavy clouds
soon rolled up from the westward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“A storm is coming,” whispered Joe to his
father.</p>

<p>“I won’t mind that,” answered the parent.
“It may make the work we have cut out for ourselves
easier.”</p>

<p>Soon came the patter of rain, at first scatteringly,
and then in a steady downpour. Under the
trees of the forest it remained dry for a time, but
at last the downpour reached them and they were
soon wet to the skin.</p>

<p>“This isn’t pleasant, is it?” whispered Harry
to Joe. “But if only it helps us in our plan I
shan’t care.”</p>

<p>Before the river was gained they had to cross
an open space. As they advanced Pep Frost
called a sudden halt and dropped in the long
grass, and the others followed suit.</p>

<p>Hardly were our friends flat than several Indians
came in that direction, each carrying a
bundle, the same that had been opened and inspected
the night before. They passed within
fifty feet of the whites, but without discovering
their presence.</p>

<p>“That was a close shave,” whispered Joe when
the last of the red men had finally disappeared
in the vicinity of some rocks to the northward.</p>

<p>“Reckon they are striking out for some sort o’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
shelter,” said Pep Frost. “I’m mighty glad on
it, too,” he added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Thar was three o’ ’em, lad, an’ thet means
three less down by the river a-guardin’ the
prisoners.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” cried the young pioneer. “I
wish some more would come this way.”</p>

<p>The storm was now on them in all of its fury.
There was no thunder or lightning, but the rain
came down in sheets, and they were glad enough
when the shelter of the forest was gained once
more. They were now close to the river, and in
a few minutes reached the spot where Joe had
landed in the borrowed canoe. The craft still lay
hidden where the young pioneer had left it.</p>

<p>“The canoe may come in very useful, should
we wish to escape in a hurry,” said Ezra Winship.</p>

<p>While the others remained at the water’s edge,
Pep Frost went forward once again on the scout.
Joe begged to be taken along, but the old pioneer
demurred.</p>

<p>“No use on it, lad, an’, besides, it’s risky.
Sence you helped us to git away them Injuns is
sure to be on stricter guard nor ever.”</p>

<p>Left to themselves, the others decided to float
the canoe and hold it in readiness for use. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
was an easy matter, and Joe remained in the craft,
paddle in hand, while Harry and Mr. Winship
stood on the river bank on guard.</p>

<p>Thus nearly half an hour went by. The rain
came down as steadily as ever, and the sky was
now inky black.</p>

<p>“It’s time Pep Frost was back,” said Ezra
Winship at last. “I hope nothing has happened
to him.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later they heard a murmur of
voices in the Indian camp, and then a scream
which, however, was quickly suppressed.</p>

<p>“I cannot stand the suspense,” declared Mr.
Winship. “Boys, watch out until I get back,”
and without further words he followed in the
trail Pep Frost had taken.</p>

<p>The scream had excited Joe as well as his
father, for he felt that it was his sister Harmony
who had uttered the cry.</p>

<p>“I’m going to push the canoe out to the edge
of the brushwood,” he whispered to Harry. “I
think I can see the Indian camp from that point,
if they have any torches lit.”</p>

<p>Noiselessly he shoved the light craft forward
until the edge of the bushes was reached. He
peered forward cautiously, and then went out a
little further. Only the fierce rain greeted him,
and the silent river seemed deserted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>At last he caught sight of the flare of a torch,
spluttering fitfully in the rain and the wind. It
was a good hundred yards away, and he made out
the forms of several Indians with difficulty. Then
he discovered another torch on the river and saw
that it was fastened at the bow of a canoe which
had just been set in motion.</p>

<p>“Save me!” came suddenly to his ears. “Oh,
save me, Mrs. Parsons. Do not let this horrid
Indian carry me away from you!”</p>

<p>“Harmony!” burst from Joe’s lips.</p>

<p>He was right, his sister was in the canoe, held
there by the hand of a tall and fierce-looking
warrior. With the other hand the red man was
using his paddle to force the craft up the stream.
As the canoe came closer Joe recognized the warrior.
It was Long Knife, the savage chief who
had led the attack on the pioneers’ camp.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE RAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> filled Joe’s heart with a nameless dread to
see his sister being thus carried off by an Indian
he knew was as cruel as he was bloodthirsty.</p>

<p>“I must save her,” was his thought. “I must
save her, no matter what the cost!”</p>

<p>In haste he shoved his canoe back to the bank
and called softly to Harry.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Joe?” asked his chum,
in an equally low tone of voice.</p>

<p>In a few hurried words the situation was explained.
“Tell father I have gone after the
pair,” Joe added.</p>

<p>Without more conversation, Joe started his
canoe forward again, and was soon on the river
and in pursuit of the other canoe, which was now
a hundred yards or more ahead.</p>

<p>By the aid of the torch in the bow he kept Long
Knife’s craft in view with ease, while his own
canoe was invisible to the red man on account of
the rain and the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>As he crept closer Joe could hear his sister begging
piteously of the Indian to let her go back to
Mrs. Parsons.</p>

<p>“Please, please, let me go back!” cried Harmony.
“Oh, have you no heart?”</p>

<p>“White maiden be quiet,” growled Long
Knife. “Can talk much after she is in Long
Knife’s wigwam.”</p>

<p>“I do not want to go to your wigwam,”
moaned the girl. “I want to go back to the lady
I was with.”</p>

<p>“Bah! the old Quaker woman does not count,”
was Long Knife’s comment. “She is not as
good as the squaw that shall take care of the
white maiden.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any squaw to take care of me,”
answered Harmony, and then fell to weeping
silently.</p>

<p>So far Joe had formed no plan of rescue. Long
Knife had dropped his hold of the girl and was
now paddling vigorously with both hands, and it
was all the young pioneer could do to keep him in
sight.</p>

<p>When about half a mile of the river had been
covered, they came to a spot where there was
something of a lake. Here Long Knife paddled
with less speed and Joe came closer rapidly.</p>

<p>In the canoe the youth had the bow and arrows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
made for him by Pep Frost, and also a stout club
he had cut for himself.</p>

<p>“I wish I had a gun instead of the bow,” he
thought. “I’d soon knock him over as he deserves.”</p>

<p>Picking up the bow and an arrow Joe adjusted
the latter with care. Harmony had sunk to the
bottom of the canoe, while Long Knife stood upright,
trying, by the flare of the torch, to find a
suitable landing.</p>

<p>The canoes were now not over a hundred feet
apart. With a strong use of the paddle the young
pioneer sent his craft thirty or forty feet closer.
Then he leaped to the bow and aimed the arrow
with all the accuracy at his command.</p>

<p>Whiz! the arrow shot forth, and had the
object at which it was aimed not moved at that
instant Long Knife would have received the shaft
straight under the shoulder blade. But just then
the canoe bumped on a part of the bank that was
under water, and the Indian pitched slightly forward,
which caused the shaft to graze his
shoulder and his neck.</p>

<p>“What is the white maiden doing?” he cried
in his native tongue, as he grasped the bow of
the canoe to keep from going overboard.</p>

<p>Harmony did not answer, for she did not understand
the question. But she saw the arrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
before it caught the eye of the Indian, and turning
to see who fired it, discovered her brother
and set up a cry of joy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe! Joe! Save me!”</p>

<p>“I will if I can,” he answered, and reached for
another arrow.</p>

<p>By this time Long Knife had recovered and
was peering forth into the gloom to learn from
what point the attack was coming, and how many
of the whites were at hand.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that Joe was excited, and
his hand trembled somewhat as he adjusted the
second arrow and let it fly without stopping to
take a careful aim.</p>

<p>But the hand of Providence was in that shot,
and Long Knife was taken fairly and squarely in
the breast.</p>

<p>The wound was not a mortal one, but it was
enough to take all the fight out of the Indian.
With a groan of pain he fell in the bow of the
canoe. Then, fearing another shot, or perhaps a
blow from a hunting knife, he slipped overboard,
staggered ashore, and disappeared in the total
darkness of the forest.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe!” These were the only words that
Harmony could utter, but as the two canoes
glided together, she arose and threw her arms
around her brother’s neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Just then the brother uttered no reply to this
warm greeting. He had seen Long Knife disappear
into the forest, and he did not know but that
the Indian might return to the attack almost immediately.</p>

<p>Two steps took him to the bow of the other
canoe, and with a handful of water he dashed out
the light of the torch. Then he seized the paddle
and began to work the craft out into midstream,
shoving the other canoe along at the same time.</p>

<p>But Long Knife was in no condition to attack
anybody, and soon the dim outline of the shore
faded from view. Then Joe tied the smaller craft
fast to the larger, and transferred his bow and
arrows and club to the latter. He bent over his
sister, and in the midst of the wind and the rain
he kissed her.</p>

<p>“It was a close shave, Harmony,” he said.
His heart was too full to say more.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe!” She clung to him tightly. “Was
it not terrible? Supposing he had carried me
off, miles and miles away?”</p>

<p>“Don’t make too much noise, Harmony—there
may be redskins all along this river bank.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything of father and
mother?”</p>

<p>“I was with father when I discovered you in
the canoe with Long Knife. He and Pep Brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
and Harry Parsons were all with me, and we
were getting ready to do what we could to rescue
you and Mrs. Parsons. I don’t know anything
about mother.”</p>

<p>“She was carried off by two of the Indians—Mrs.
Parsons saw it done.”</p>

<p>“It’s queer the redskins separated.”</p>

<p>“The attack was made by two tribes, one
under Long Knife, and the other under an Indian
called Red Feather, a horrible-looking savage
with a broken nose.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen anything of that savage. But
now we had best keep quiet, Harmony, for we are
getting close to the Indian camp again.”</p>

<p>Joe was right. Caught by the current of the
river the two canoes were drifting down the
stream rapidly. The rain still descended steadily
although not as heavily as before.</p>

<p>So far no sound had reached them from the
vicinity of the camp where Mrs. Parsons was still
held a captive, but now a distant shout could be
heard, followed by a war-whoop, and then two
gun shots.</p>

<p>“Some sort of an attack is on!” cried the boy.
“I trust our side wins out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so do I, Joe. Did you say father and
Mr. Frost had guns?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they most likely fired those two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
shots. Hark to the war-whoops! The redskins
are making it lively. I’d like to know if Harry
is in that mix-up.”</p>

<p>Joe turned the canoes toward the river bank,
and after a careful survey of the locality discovered
the spot where he had left his chum.</p>

<p>“Harry!” he called softly. “Harry!”</p>

<p>No answer came back, and with caution he
shoved the leading canoe through the brushwood
toward the bank.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, Harmony, while I try to find out
how the fight is going,” he said, and leaped
ashore, hunting knife in hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe, don’t leave me,” she pleaded, but he
was already gone.</p>

<p>It was an easy matter to crawl to the vicinity
of the Indian camp from where the canoes lay
hidden. The whooping and the shots had ended
as suddenly as they had begun.</p>

<p>Suddenly Joe stumbled over the dead body of
an Indian, still warm, and with blood flowing
from a wound in the breast. The discovery was
a shock to the young pioneer, and he felt a great
desire to jump up and fly from the scene.</p>

<p>Hardly had he made this discovery than he ran
across Harry, leaning against a tree, gasping for
breath.</p>

<p>“Harry,” he cried, and caught his chum just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
he was about to fall in a heap. “Where are you
hit?”</p>

<p>“Some—somebody struck me in the—the
stomach with a—a—club,” was the gasped-out
reply. “Oh!” And then Harry sank like a
lump of lead.</p>

<p>Without stopping to think twice Joe picked up
the form of his chum and started for the canoes
once more. It was a heavy load, but the excitement
of the moment gave the youth added
strength.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” called Harmony, through the
rain.</p>

<p>“I’ve got Harry, Harmony. He has been hit
with a club.”</p>

<p>“And father and Mr. Frost?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where they are.”</p>

<p>But scarcely had the young pioneer spoken
when there came a rush of footsteps, and Pep
Frost appeared on the scene, closely followed by
Ezra Winship, who carried the unconscious form
of Mrs. Parsons.</p>

<p>“Father!” burst from the girl’s lips.</p>

<p>“My daughter!” ejaculated the astonished
parent. “How did you get here? I thought
that Long Knife had carried you off in a
canoe.”</p>

<p>“So he did, but Joe came after me and brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
me back, after knocking Long Knife over with
two arrows.”</p>

<p>“Got two canoes, eh?” came from Pep Frost.
“By gum, but they air jest wot we need. In
ye go, all of ye, an’ quick!”</p>

<p>But little more was said. All leaped into the
canoes, taking the unconscious woman and boy
with them. Then they shoved off into the river.</p>

<p>They were not a moment too soon, for as the
darkness swallowed them up they heard the Indians
in the brushwood, running forward and
backward along the bank, and calling guardedly
to each other. They did not imagine that the
whites had the boats, and supposed they must be
in hiding, most likely half in and half out of the
water.</p>

<p>Not knowing what else to do the whites headed
the two canoes up the stream for a short distance
and then landed on the opposite shore, at a point
where some walls of rock seemed to promise a
little shelter from the driving rain.</p>

<p>As they went ashore Mrs. Parsons recovered
her senses, for she had merely fainted from the
excitement.</p>

<p>“What has happened to me?” she asked
faintly.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, you are now safe, Mistress Parsons,”
answered Ezra Winship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“Providence be praised for it!” responded the
Quakeress piously. Then her gaze fell upon her
son and she uttered a slight shriek. “Harry!
Oh, tell me not that he is killed!”</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t dead,” answered Joe. And
shortly after that Harry sat up, declaring that
he was all right excepting that his stomach felt
very sore.</p>

<p>“We knocked over three o’ the redskins,” said
Pep Frost. “Then the rest dug fer the woods
an’ we rushed in and freed Mrs. Parsons. But it
was a lively fight, and I don’t know as we air
out o’ it yet,” he added significantly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>DAYS OF PERIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> Pep Frost was as tired out as anybody
in the party, yet the old pioneer did not rest
until he had found a cave-like opening under some
of the largest of the rocks in that vicinity.</p>

<p>To this spot all of the party retired, and here
found shelter from the rain and wind, and here
they remained until morning.</p>

<p>By that time the storm had passed away and
the sun came out as brightly as ever. Joe and his
father managed to find a little dry wood and with
this a fire was kindled, all being careful to keep
the smoke from ascending in a solid cloud. By
the fire the remainder of the bear meat was
cooked, and all partook of their share and washed
down the meal with a drink from a nearby spring.</p>

<p>How to turn next was the all-important question,
and nobody had a very definite answer.</p>

<p>“O’ course we can push on westward fer Fort
Boone,” said Pep Frost. “But I aint allowin’
as how ye want to do thet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Thee art right, friend Frost,” answered Mrs.
Parsons. “I would first learn what has become
of my daughter Clara, and I doubt not but what
Friend Winship would like to learn what has become
of his good wife, Mistress Winship, and his
daughter Cora.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” answered Ezra Winship. “If
they are dead I want to know it, and if they have
been carried off I feel that I must do all I can
to rescue them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, we must learn the truth,” cried
Harmony, while Joe nodded his head to show
that he agreed.</p>

<p>A discussion followed that lasted fully an hour,
and then it was decided that Mr. Winship and
Pep Frost should go off on a scout, leaving Joe
and Harry to watch over Mrs. Parsons and Harmony.</p>

<p>“We may not be back in two or three days,”
said Ezra Winship. “For we will not only try
to learn what has become of all the other members
of the company that was with us before the attack,
but also try to find some of the things that
belong to us.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the things, father,” said Joe.
“Just find mother and Cora and I’ll be content.”</p>

<p>“And I say to thee, find Clara and I will be
content, Friend Winship,” added Mrs. Parsons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>In the canoe that Long Knife had occupied was
a small bag containing Indian meal, and another
containing pease, and a strip of jerked beef, so
that those left behind would not starve during the
absence of the men. The men themselves took
nothing but the guns and horns of powder, ball
and shot, with a tinder box, declaring that they
would hunt down whatever they needed.</p>

<p>“Do not show yourselves on the river,” were
Ezra Winship’s last words of caution. “Those
redskins are still over there, and they may remain
there for days, trying to locate us.”</p>

<p>After the two men had left, the spot seemed
lonelier than ever. To occupy her time Mrs. Parsons
soaked some of the pease in a hollow of
water, and then set them to baking on a flat stone,
rimmed with dried clay. On another flat stone
she mixed some of the Indian meal into a dough
which afterwards turned out into fairly good
corn cakes. While this was going on Harry set
to work fishing in a pool under the brushwood
bordering the river, and caught several fish of
fair size.</p>

<p>“To be sure, ’tis not eating fit for a king,” declared
Mrs. Parsons, “but for such as ’tis, let us
all be truly thankful.” And they were thankful.</p>

<p>While the others were thus occupied, with Harmony
doing what she could to help the Quakeress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Joe took his way to the top of the rocks. Here
grew a tree of good size, and this he easily
climbed to the top.</p>

<p>The view he obtained from this elevation was
a disappointment to him. As far as eye could
reach stretched the hills and valleys, with here and
there a stream of water and a tiny lake. Across
the river directly in front of him he could see the
late Indian camp, now deserted, and this was the
only sign of life anywhere.</p>

<p>“Not even a deer, much less a white man or an
Indian,” he murmured. “But then I suppose the
redskins are keeping out of sight the same as ourselves.”</p>

<p>He looked long and earnestly in the direction
his father and Pep Frost had taken, but neither of
them appeared, and at last he descended and rejoined
the others.</p>

<p>The day passed quietly until about four o’clock
in the afternoon, when Harry, returning from
another fishing expedition, a little further down
the river, announced that two canoes were in
sight, each containing at least half a dozen Indians.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope they don’t attempt to land here!”
cried Harmony, in dismay.</p>

<p>“We’ll put out the fire and hide,” said Joe, and
this was done, Mrs. Parsons and the girl secreting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
themselves in a nearby split in the rocks, and
Harry and Joe taking themselves close to the
water’s edge where they might watch the progress
of the canoes.</p>

<p>The canoes were large affairs, and as they came
closer the two young pioneers saw that they contained
other persons besides the Indians. There
was a heap of goods in the center of each canoe,
and likewise several captives.</p>

<p>“Clara is in the front canoe,” whispered
Harry excitedly.</p>

<p>“And Cora is in the other,” announced Joe a
moment later.</p>

<p>The other captives were men and women who
had belonged to the unfortunate expedition. All
had their hands tied behind them, and not a few
were suffering from wounds made by arrows and
tomahawks.</p>

<p>“Those Indians must belong to the tribe under
Red Feather,” whispered Harry, and he was right,
as it later on proved.</p>

<p>The boys were itching to do something for
their captive sisters and the others of their friends,
but such a move was, just then, out of the question.
Their only weapons were their bows and
arrows, and the canoes hugged the opposite
shore, too far to be reached with any degree of
accuracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“I am going to follow those canoes as far as
I can,” declared Joe, and ran along the river bank
behind the brushwood. But soon the rocks and
a curve of the watercourse cut him off, and a little
later the two canoes passed from sight.</p>

<p>When the craft were gone the two youths went
back to where the others had been left. Both
Mrs. Parsons and Harmony were, of course, surprised
to learn that they had seen Cora and
Clara.</p>

<p>“Where will they take them?” cried Harmony,
wringing her hands, while the tears stood in the
Quakeress’ eyes.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if there was an Indian
village somewhere up this stream,” said Joe.
“If you’ll remember, Long Knife spoke about
taking Harmony to his wigwam.”</p>

<p>“Father said he had heard of an Indian village
up there,” answered Harry. “Daniel Boone
told him of it. Boone was at the village once,
when the redskins were off on a hunt.”</p>

<p>“I wish Daniel Boone was here now,” answered
Joe. “He knows how to fight Indians, if
anybody does.”</p>

<p>“He may be in this vicinity for all we know,”
put in Harmony. “He doesn’t stay at Fort
Boone all the time.”</p>

<p>Harmony was very anxious to know if her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
mother had been in either of the canoes, but
neither Joe nor Harry could answer that query.</p>

<p>“There were some folks we couldn’t see on account
of the distance and the goods piled up in
the canoes,” said Joe. “I wouldn’t be surprised
if she was there.”</p>

<p>Night came on quickly and they remained in
the dark, not caring to light another camp-fire.</p>

<p>Harry climbed a tree to see if he could detect
any fire in that vicinity.</p>

<p>“Not even a torch,” he declared on coming below.
“Everybody on both sides is keeping
shady.”</p>

<p>“Those Indians that went by didn’t keep very
shady, Harry.”</p>

<p>“That is true, Joe,—which proves that they
didn’t belong to the party that we have been fighting.
It’s more than likely they have met some of
the others since passing here, and now they are on
guard like ourselves.”</p>

<p>It was decided that the boys should take
turns at picket duty, as Harry called it, for it was
not deemed wise for all to sleep at once.</p>

<p>The two boys drew straws as to which should
keep awake the first half of the night, and it fell
to Harry’s lot. Worn out, Joe turned in immediately,
if not to sleep at least to rest, and Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Parsons and Harmony soon followed his example.
But, though their minds were in sore distress,
abused Nature soon claimed her own, and all slept
the sleep of the exhausted.</p>

<p>To keep his own eyes open Harry moved
around, up and down the rocks, and then along
a stretch of the river bank which was comparatively
free from brushwood and trees.</p>

<p>It was a lonely vigil, and more than once the
youth’s eyes closed in spite of himself. To keep
himself awake he decided to bathe his head and
arms.</p>

<p>He was engaged in this agreeable occupation
when something floating on the surface of the
river attracted his attention. At first he could not
distinguish what it was, but at last made it out
to be a small tree, or large tree branch. On the
top rested a dark object that looked like the
huddled form of a man.</p>

<p>“Hullo, here is something new!” he thought.
“If that is a man is it a white person or an Indian?”</p>

<p>As the object came nearer he strained his eyes
to see more clearly. As he did this, the man on
the driftwood raised himself slightly and gave a
moan.</p>

<p>“A white man, and he is likely wounded,” said
the young pioneer to himself, and without hesitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
he ran for one of the canoes, launched it, and
soon had the sufferer ashore.</p>

<p>Harry had called Joe while launching the canoe,
and now the latter joined him and the two carried
the unknown one to the shelter under the rocks.
He was suffering from a wound in the shoulder,
and from another in the left leg, and both of these
were bound up by Mrs. Parsons, who in her
younger days had been a famous nurse for the
sick and wounded.</p>

<p>It was noon of the next day before the unknown
man opened his eyes and attempted to sit up.</p>

<p>“You—you are kind to me,” he gasped—“very
kind, madam, and I will not forget you
for it.”</p>

<p>“How came you in such a situation?” questioned
Harry.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, my son, do not question so sick a
mortal,” interposed Mrs. Parsons. “Time
enough when he is stronger.”</p>

<p>“The story is soon told,” said the wounded
man with an effort. “I was on my way from
Fort Boone, with Daniel Boone and three others,
to join a party which is expected there soon by a
man there named Peter Parsons——”</p>

<p>“My husband!” ejaculated Mrs. Parsons.</p>

<p>“Then you are of that party?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“’Tis a strange place for you, madam.” The
wounded man looked at the rocks. “But as I was
saying, I was with Boone and the others, when
we became separated in the heavy rainstorm.
The Indians tracked me, and I was wounded and
captured. But some time ago I escaped and fled
to the river. Then I swam to a tree that was
floating by, and crawled on it more dead than
alive. And now I am here, thanks——”</p>

<p>The wounded man got no further, for at that
moment the form of a man appeared on the rocks
above the shelter—a tall white man, dressed in
the garb of a hunter.</p>

<p>“Hullo, who are you?” demanded Joe, leaping
to his feet and feeling for his hunting knife.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s Daniel Boone!” cried the
wounded man, before the newcomer could answer
Joe’s question.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>DANIEL BOONE, THE PIONEER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the time this story opens, Daniel Boone,
known to history as the famous hero and pioneer
of Kentucky, was about forty years of age. He
was tall and well-formed, and had an eye that was
as sharp as it was true. He could hit a bird on
the wing, or a speeding deer with ease, and there
was an old saying that if Boone drew bead on an
animal the game was as good as dead.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone was born in Bucks County,
Pennsylvania, in 1735. His boyhood days were
spent on the farm, and in hunting and fishing,
pastimes of which he was passionately fond.
He also had a strong “fever” for roaming, and
more than once was missing at night, having
gone on a tramp miles and miles from home.</p>

<p>When Boone was about thirteen years of age,
his family moved to a place called Holman’s Ford,
on the Yadkin River, in North Carolina. Here
the youth grew to manhood and married the
daughter of a neighbor, a sweet and courageous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
girl by the name of Rebecca Bryan. It is well to
remember that name, for, as Daniel Boone was
the pioneer of Kentucky, Mrs. Boone—Rebecca
Bryan—was the pioneer woman of that great
commonwealth. It took courage on the part of a
man to penetrate the wilderness, but it took even
more courage on the part of a woman with children
to do the same thing.</p>

<p>When Daniel Boone married he still made his
home on the Yadkin, but further westward than
where his father was located. At first he had a
wide range of territory to himself, which was
just to his liking, but presently other settlers discovered
the richness of this land and came to
settle near him.</p>

<p>“We are going to be crowded out, wife,” said
he to Mrs. Boone. “From our doorstep I can see
the smoke of five other cabins in the valley.”
This great hunter loved solitude, and he thought
he was being “crowded” even when he could but
see his neighbors.</p>

<p>Boone’s thought had often turned to the West—to
that vast, mysterious land which lay beyond
the Cumberland Mountains—that land which to-day
forms the State of Kentucky with its many
cities and towns, but which only a hundred and
twenty-five years ago was an unbroken wilderness,
inhabited by wandering red men and vast herds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
of buffalo, deer, and other wild animals. A hundred
and twenty-five years! Reader, how quickly
our great country has grown to be what it is!</p>

<p>A well-known hunter of that time, John Finley
by name, had made a short tour westward, and
he brought back with him a wonderful account of
what he had seen—the great forests, fertile fields,
streams rich with fish, and the large quantities of
game. Daniel Boone met this man and talked
with him, and from that hour determined to move
westward on his own account at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>It was on the first day of May, 1769, that Boone
bade farewell to his wife and children, and started
out on his explorations. He had with him five
companions, all hunters and pioneers like himself,
and including the John Finley already mentioned.
The party traveled through the mountains and
valleys for five weeks, often stopping to hunt and
fish on the way, and then reached the Red River,
and from a tall cliff looked for the first time on
the beautiful plains and woodlands of Kentucky.</p>

<p>“What a grand, what a glorious prospect!”
exclaimed Boone.</p>

<p>“It will prove a paradise on earth,” answered
one of his companions.</p>

<p>A shelter was erected close to the river, and the
whole party went into camp until late in the year,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
making many tours of discovery to the north,
west, and south. On one of these tours Boone
and one of his companions were surprised by the
Indians and made prisoners. The Indians treated
them roughly and threatened them with all sorts
of torture. At the end of a week, however, the
two captives watched their chance, and escaped.
When they got back to their old camp they found
it plundered, and the others of the party had gone
home.</p>

<p>“We had better go home too,” said Boone’s
companion, and they started without delay. On
the way they met Squire Boone, Daniel Boone’s
brother, and another man. Shortly after this the
man who had been a captive with Boone was
killed, and the hunter who had come West with
Squire Boone returned to his home. This left the
two brothers alone.</p>

<p>All winter the two Boones hunted and explored
the region, keeping away from all the Indians of
that vicinity. When spring came Squire Boone
returned home, leaving Daniel alone to the solitude
of the great forests.</p>

<p>This was what Daniel Boone really loved, and
not a day was lost during the time he was left
alone. He explored the territory for miles
around, and paddled his way on many a stream.
Thus three months passed, and then the brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
returned with pack horses and a load of much
needed provisions and a goodly supply of powder.</p>

<p>With all the time already spent in this vast
wilderness, Daniel Boone was not yet satisfied to
go back to his home on the Yadkin, and it was
not until March, 1771, that he and his brother retraced
their steps to civilization. In that time
they had gained a wonderful insight into the
country, and could now speak with authority of
its formation and worth. They were familiar
with every trail worth knowing, and could tell
true stories of the richness of the soil.</p>

<p>But in those days things moved rather slowly,
and it took two years to bring a number of the
settlers up to the point of moving westward with
their belongings. It was the end of September,
1773, that Daniel Boone and his brother, Squire
Boone, with their families, moved to a place called
Powell’s Valley. Here they were joined by five
other families and forty men.</p>

<p>It was a hopeful beginning of the great work of
settling the West, but it came to a speedy and
disastrous termination. The pioneers had been
but two weeks on the march when a band of Indians
fell upon some of the young men who had
gone out to round up the cattle. The fight was
short and sharp, and six of the young men, including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
Daniel Boone’s oldest son, a lad of seventeen,
were killed.</p>

<p>This was a great shock to the other members
of the expedition, and despite the earnest protestations
of Daniel and Squire Boone, it was decided
to turn back.</p>

<p>“We can do nothing against the redskins,”
said one timid hunter. “They will turn in some
dark night and massacre the whole of us.”</p>

<p>But though this expedition turned back, the
disaster did not dim the fame of Daniel Boone.
He was known far and wide as Colonel Boone,
the discoverer of Kentucky, and this fame reached
even to the courts of Virginia, and he was often
consulted regarding this “promised land” which
he had explored. He was sent out at one time to
assist a number of surveyors, and at another to
open negotiations with the Indians, and his work
in these directions served to increase his fame
materially.</p>

<p>It was in the autumn of 1774 that a treaty was
made with the Cherokee Indians by which all the
land between the Cumberland and Kentucky
Rivers passed into the control of a body known as
the Transylvania Company. Immediately steps
were taken to survey the territory, and to establish
a trail which might be used by prospective
settlers. It was a difficult task, and it fell to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
lot of Daniel Boone to lead the way from a settlement
on the Holston to the Kentucky River.</p>

<p>The Indians had been willing to negotiate the
sale of the land, but when they saw an actual road
being made through their beloved country they
grew enraged, and soon there was a skirmish, in
which two of Boone’s party fell, and he narrowly
escaped death. But the expedition stood its
ground, until it reached the site of the present
village of Boonesborough, located about eighteen
miles southeast of the city of Lexington. Here
no time was lost in building a fort, and in making
other defenses against the red men.</p>

<p>As soon as the stronghold was complete, Daniel
Boone went back to the East and brought on his
wife and children, and they were speedily joined
by several other families. Then other settlements
besides that of Boonesborough began to appear,
and it was then that Peter Parsons went westward
to see for himself if this “land of plenty”
of which he had heard so much was really as
good as pictured.</p>

<p>Mr. Parsons was delighted, both with the
aspect of the country and with the kind-heartedness
of Colonel Boone and the other hunters and
pioneers that he met, and it did not take him long
to reach the conclusion that a home here, if once
the Indians could be brought to submission,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
would be most desirable. He was naturally a
man who wanted freedom, and the troubles in the
eastern settlements, where the discontentment that
led to the Revolution was already in evidence,
were exceedingly distasteful to him.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Parsons had sent for his family
and that of Ezra Winship to come on, he set about
clearing some of the land of the sites he had selected.
He was hard at work one day felling
some trees when an unexpected wind came along
and knocked a tree over on him, hurting his leg.
He was carried into the fort, and there he lay
for several weeks while the hurt member grew
better.</p>

<p>“It is too bad,” said he to Daniel Boone. “I
was going out to meet my family and the others
that are expected here. I have heard that the Indians
are growing ugly again, and I am afraid
that they will encounter trouble.”</p>

<p>“You must not think of standing on that hurt
leg yet,” answered Colonel Boone. “I am going
out myself, in company with Jerry Wright and
several others of our best marksmen. We shall
do our best to bring your family and the others
to this fort in safety.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Colonel,” answered Peter Parsons.
“If you’ll do that I will rest content.
When do you calculate to start?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Early to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>Daniel Boone was as good as his word, and the
party of five was several miles away from the fort
by the time the sun rose. Each man was mounted
on a good horse, and the only stop made that day
was for the midday meal, and to feed and water
the steeds.</p>

<p>For several days nothing out of the usual occurred
excepting that they found the remains of
several Indian camp-fires, which showed that the
red men were in that vicinity in force.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they are gathering to attack the
party under this Ezra Winship,” said Jerry
Wright, who had been a great friend of Boone’s
son—the one who had been killed—and who was
well liked by the great hunter himself.</p>

<p>“I trust not, Jerry,” replied Daniel Boone.
“We want no more massacres here.”</p>

<p>It was then that the great rainstorm came on,
and during this Jerry Wright’s horse ran away
from him. The young hunter went after the
steed, and in the darkness became separated from
his companions. His trail was discovered by
some Indians, and before he could recover his
horse he was discovered and the Indians set upon
him with fierce shouts. He tried to defend himself,
but was wounded, and then the red men made
him their captive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Jerry Wright fully expected death at the hands
of his enemies, but it did not come, and watching
his chance, he escaped from the Indians and ran
for the river. Here he swam out to a floating
tree and crawled on top; and it was from this
position of peril that Harry rescued him, as
already described in the last chapter.</p>

<small>BOONE LEADS THE WAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Daniel Boone!</span>”</p>

<p>The cry came from several lips at once, and not
only Harry and Joe, but also Mrs. Parsons and
Harmony, leaped up to meet the newcomer on the
rocks.</p>

<p>“Hullo! Reckon I’ve struck some sort of a
camp,” were Colonel Boone’s first words. Then
he looked at his late companion. “Where did
you go to in the rain, and what is the matter of
you?” he continued.</p>

<p>“Oh, Colonel Boone, how glad I am to see
you!” exclaimed Harmony.</p>

<p>The great hunter nodded and descended to the
shelter.</p>

<p>“Thank you, miss—but I don’t reckon I know
you,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“I am Harmony Winship, and this is my
brother Joe. This is Mrs. Parsons and her son
Harry. We were all on our way to join Mr.
Parsons at your fort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Tell me, good sir, how is my husband?” put
in the Quakeress quickly.</p>

<p>Before answering Boone removed his coonskin
cap and bowed politely. “He is tolerably well,
madam, but for his leg, which he hurt while felling
trees in the forest. But for his hurt he might
be with me this moment.”</p>

<p>“Is it serious?”</p>

<p>“Far from it, and I doubt not but that he will
be up and around before we get back. But where
are the others of the expedition, and why are you
in such a place as this? And why are you here?”
went on Colonel Boone to Jerry Wright.</p>

<p>It took the best part of half an hour to acquaint
the great hunter with all that had occurred, both
to the party under the leadership of Ezra Winship,
and to his late companion. Boone listened
quietly, but as he learned of the attacks by the
Indians his brow grew dark and his lips were
tightly compressed.</p>

<p>“They are nothing but fiends after all—after
all the promises they have made,” he said at last.
“To trust them even for a moment seems foolish.”
He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “When
do you expect Mr. Winship and Frost back?”
he questioned of the boys.</p>

<p>“I suppose they will be back sometime to-day,”
answered Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>Colonel Boone told them that he had left the
others of his party on a trail quarter of a mile
away, having come on foot to the river bank to
see if any Indians were in sight, or to learn, if
possible, what had become of Wright.</p>

<p>“I will go back and bring my companions to
this place,” he said. “And then we can talk over
what is to be done.”</p>

<p>“If thee will but get us safe to the fort I shall
ask no more,” said Mrs. Parsons.</p>

<p>Before sundown the other hunters and pioneers
came up and were introduced. They were glad to
learn that Jerry Wright was not seriously
wounded, and one brought the good news that the
missing horse had turned up unharmed.</p>

<p>Fortunately for those in distress the party
under Colonel Boone had brought with them a
fair supply of provisions and also a couple of
extra rifles and three long pistols, with ammunition.
Each of the young pioneers was provided
with a rifle and ammunition, and even Mrs. Parsons
accepted one of the pistols, while Harmony took
another.</p>

<p>Colonel Boone was of a humor to follow up the
canoes with captives that had passed up the river,
but after a talk with his companions it was decided
to wait until morning to see if Mr. Winship
and Pep Frost might not return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“The Indians must not be allowed to go too
far,” said Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>“But with even my father and Frost we will
number but eight,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“True, lad; but I calculate that a good white
hunter is worth four or five redskins,” answered
Boone.</p>

<p>The well-known old hunter was dressed in the
typical garb of that period—loose hunting shirt,
or frock, of dressed deer skins, leggings of leather,
fringed on the outer seam, and a coonskin cap, in
which was stuck a curled feather or two, and on
the feet a pair of coarse, heavy moccasins.
Around his waist the hunter wore a substantial
belt, with a tomahawk at his right side, and on
the left his long hunting knife, powder horn, bullet
pouch, and small metal case containing extra
flints and tinder.</p>

<p>All were seated around a tiny camp-fire at
about eight o’clock that evening, when Boone
suddenly arose.</p>

<p>“Somebody is coming,” he said.</p>

<p>Neither of the boys had heard a sound out of
the ordinary, nor had some of the others for that
matter. But Daniel Boone’s ears were trained to
woodcraft, and he had caught the cracking of
some brushwood a good distance away. He
picked up his rifle and moved out of the circle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
light, and several of the other men followed his
example.</p>

<p>It was soon seen that Ezra Winship and Pep
Frost were approaching, followed by two men
and several women and children—all members of
that ill-fated band that had suffered so much but
a short while before. One of the men was
wounded in the shoulder, and one of the children
had been partly scalped.</p>

<p>It can well be imagined that Ezra Winship was
glad to meet Daniel Boone, whom he knew so
well by reputation, if not personally.</p>

<p>“We need your assistance sorely,” said Mr.
Winship. “Our whole party has been either
killed, taken prisoners, or scattered, and I must
say that I hardly know what to do.”</p>

<p>He listened closely to what Joe had to tell
him about the canoes that had gone up the
river.</p>

<p>“Your mother must have been of the party,”
said he. “For I have learned that she and Cora
and Clara Parsons were together.” He turned to
Boone. “Colonel Boone, where do you think the
captives will be taken?”</p>

<p>“’Tis hard to tell, Winship,” was the reply.
“Perhaps to the village of Go-wan-shi-ska. That
is a favorite spot with them at this season of the
year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>In their trip back to the former camp Mr. Winship
and Pep Frost had seen but two Indians and
they were a long distance off. In coming through
a patch of timber they had heard the cry of a child
and this had led them to a shelter where they had
found those that they had now brought with
them.</p>

<p>“We must rescue those who have been carried
off,” said Ezra Winship. “I cannot consent to
go on to the fort until that is done. My own
wife and daughter are missing and so are five or
six others. To leave them to the mercy of the
savages would not be human.”</p>

<p>“We cannot go after the missing ones until we
have seen the women and children who are here
safe,” replied Daniel Boone. “But once they are
at the fort I promise you that I will use every
effort within my power to bring back the missing
ones and avenge this great wrong.”</p>

<p>The great hunter spoke feelingly, for he had
not yet forgotten the death of his beloved son
nor the deaths of many of his old-time companions.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the whole party should
move forward under the personal guidance of
Colonel Boone without delay. The wounded and
the small children were placed on horseback, and
the men and boys, all armed, tramped on ahead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
and behind, Boone himself far in advance, making
certain that the way was clear.</p>

<p>On the way two Indians were encountered.
One was shot down and the other taken prisoner.</p>

<p>The captured red man was closely questioned
by Colonel Boone and others. At first he refused
to talk, but at last said that the tribe under Red
Feather was journeying toward Go-wan-shi-ska.
They had some captives, he did not know how
many, nor did he know how long Red Feather
intended to remain at the village before moving
further to the north.</p>

<p>When the news reached the fort that the expected
expedition had been attacked by the Indians
under Long Knife and Red Feather there
was great excitement, and a score of men, including
Peter Parsons, rode out to meet those who
were coming in.</p>

<p>“So you are safe,” said Mr. Parsons to his
wife. “I am glad of that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; but poor Clara!” groaned Mrs.
Parsons, and then burst into tears on her husband’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>The stories the various survivors of the expedition
had to tell were listened to with interest by
all at the fort, and under Colonel Boone’s command
a party of twenty-two men, young and old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
prepared to follow up the trail of the red men and
give them battle if necessary. All were aroused
to the necessity of swift action, and each man was
prepared to fight to the last in defense of his own
family and those of his companions.</p>

<p>With the men went Mr. Winship and Joe. Mr.
Parsons wanted to go, but it was thought best to
leave him and Harry behind to look after the
women folks, for it was barely possible that, during
the absence of so many of the garrison, the
Indians might attack the fort itself.</p>

<p>“You must be on guard, day and night,” said
Colonel Boone to the officer who was left in
charge. “Keep pickets out constantly and do
not allow any Indians to visit the fort proper. If
they want to parley let them do it outside and not
more than two at a time.”</p>

<p>The entire party went out on horseback, Joe
riding a steed provided by Mr. Parsons. The
young pioneer had been introduced to all of the
others in the expedition and felt thoroughly at
home among them. The men, young and old,
were a whole-souled body and willing to do
almost anything for each other.</p>

<p>It was now that Joe learned for the first time
in his life what real hard riding meant. Daniel
Boone allowed no dragging behind, and the
hunters went forward as fast as their steeds could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
carry them, up trail and down, over stretches of
deep grass and then along and over the rocks.
Often a stream would have to be swum or forded,
and the riders would have all they could do to get
over and keep their ammunition dry.</p>

<p>The first night was spent in the open, without
a camp-fire, and long before the sun arose the
party was again the saddle, riding as hard as
ever.</p>

<p>“I hope you are not tired out, Joe,” said his
father, on the way.</p>

<p>“Not yet; but how long are we to keep this
up?” questioned the son.</p>

<p>“Colonel Boone says until we see something of
the Indians. And I am glad of it,” added Ezra
Winship. “We can’t come up to those rascals
too quick for me.”</p>

<p>On the third day out, however, the speed was
slackened a little, and just before sundown Daniel
Boone and two of the other skilled hunters went
on ahead. They were moving up a hill, the ridge
of which was located in some timber quarter of a
mile away.</p>

<p>Colonel Boone and the others were gone the
best part of an hour. The remainder of the
party were then ordered to swing round to the
left of the trail they had been following and halt
just this side of the ridge of the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“The Indians are encamped in the valley on
the other side of the hill,” said Colonel Boone.
“There are about thirty of them and they have
at least some, if not all, of the captives with
them.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>WITH NO TIME TO SPARE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> Indians are encamped in the valley beyond
this hill!” cried Joe. “In that case we will
soon find out whom they have as captives with
them.”</p>

<p>With extreme caution the hunters and pioneers
climbed the slope until about fifty feet from the
ridge.</p>

<p>Then the men and boys were allowed to crawl
among the trees and brushwood to the very top
and look over into the valley below.</p>

<p>A plain of tall grass and low brush met their
gaze, extending for quarter of a mile in width
and several miles in length. In the very center
was a small brook, moving peacefully along between
the reeds and rushes.</p>

<p>The encampment of the red men was along
the bank of the watercourse next to the hill occupied
by the whites. Here several wigwams had
been temporarily erected and here two camp-fires
had just been started. On a slight rise of ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
lay several bundles of goods which belonged to
the ill-fated pioneers, and not far away several
horses and mules were tethered.</p>

<p>But the gaze of those on the ridge of the hill
was not directed to the Indians, the bundles, or
the horses, but to the captives, who were in a
group by themselves not far from one of the wigwams.</p>

<p>The captives were six in number—two women,
two girls, and two men, one of the latter just
grown to manhood. Each was bound, and it was
plain to see that each had suffered much since
being taken a prisoner.</p>

<p>“I see Cora!” exclaimed Joe in a low voice.
“Do you see mother?”</p>

<p>“I do not,” answered Ezra Winship, and the
tone of his voice showed keen disappointment.</p>

<p>“That other girl is Dorothy Reasoner, and the
two women are Mrs. Landrop and Mrs. Gellott,”
went on the boy.</p>

<p>“The men are old Hank Kassoway and young
Paul Broker, the young fellow they said looked
like you, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they have any other captives,
father?”</p>

<p>“There may be some in one of the wigwams,
but it is doubtful.”</p>

<p>Word was now passed along that the hunters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
must be silent, and for some minutes not a word
was spoken.</p>

<p>During that interval several of the Indians were
seen to run to the group of prisoners and
bring forward the young fellow named Paul
Broker.</p>

<p>In a twinkle the hunting shirt was ripped off
the young pioneer and he was hurled flat on his
back on the ground. While he was being held
there by two red men others tied cords to his
wrists and ankles and these were afterward
secured to four short stakes driven securely in the
soil.</p>

<p>“They are going to torture that young man!”
exclaimed Mr. Winship in horror.</p>

<p>After the victim was so secured that he could
scarcely move some of the Indians began to dance
around him, uttering the words of a wild song
and flourishing their tomahawks and scalping
knives. Occasionally one would leap forward
and make a move as if to cut off the nose or gouge
out an eye of the victim.</p>

<p>They thought by this to make the young man
cry out in fear and beg for mercy, but Paul
Broker had learned the lesson that the Indian is
merciless when it comes to torturing an enemy
and so he remained mute.</p>

<p>The girl and women prisoners shrieked in horror<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
at the scene and, unable to stand the sight, one
woman fainted dead away.</p>

<p>Burning fagots were now brought forward and
the Indians prepared to place them upon the naked
breast of the victim. One fagot was held close
to his face, so that his eyebrows were singed.</p>

<p>While this was going on, Boone crawled from
one to another of his party and gave a few hurried
directions.</p>

<p>It was now growing dark, and, keeping as much
in the shadows of the hill as possible, the hunters
moved over the ridge and down close to the Indian
encampment.</p>

<p>The Indians around Paul Broker were just on
the point of placing the fagots upon the victim’s
breast when Daniel Boone gave the order to open
fire.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! bang! went the rifles and shotguns,
and at the first irregular volley three of the
Indians were killed outright and five others badly
wounded. In those days powder and ball were
scarce, and no man discharged his weapon unless
he was tolerably sure of his aim.</p>

<p>“Forward!” cried Daniel Boone, and led the
way, reloading as he ran.</p>

<p>The red men had not yet thrown out their
guards for the night and were taken completely
by surprise. As the shots rang out and so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
of their number fell, the others were almost panic-stricken.</p>

<p>“The palefaces! the palefaces!” they cried,
and ran for their bows and arrows and other
weapons.</p>

<p>Colonel Boone knew well how to fight Indians
and had given instructions to make as much noise
as possible. Consequently the hunters under
him came onward with many loud yells and
shrieks, uttered in all sorts of tones, giving the
red men the impression that the attacking party
numbered a hundred or more.</p>

<p>Guns and pistols were discharged and reloaded
with all possible speed, and as the whites drew
closer they brought forth their tomahawks and
hunting knives. It was Boone himself who
leaped to the rescue of Paul Broker, closely followed
by Mr. Winship and others. Joe ran
straight to his sister Cora.</p>

<p>Realizing that the battle was against them the
Indians made but a feeble resistance, and then
those who were able did what they could to escape
across the valley to the hills.</p>

<p>As one tall red man dashed past the captives
he aimed a blow with his tomahawk at Cora. But
before the hatchet could reach the girl’s head Joe
swung around the butt of his gun and struck the
Indian’s arm a crushing blow, breaking that member<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and causing the tomahawk to fall to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Joe! Joe!” burst from Cora Winship’s lips.
She could not say more.</p>

<p>Some of the Indians attempted to reach the
horses, but were blocked and two others were
shot down. Then the rest ran in all directions,
their only idea being to hide themselves under
cover of the coming night.</p>

<p>But the pioneers were thoroughly aroused to
the situation, and, under the leadership of Daniel
Boone, those left of the evil band were hunted
not only during the night, but all of the next day.
In this hunt Joe took no part, preferring to do
the duty assigned to him and four others, namely,
that of looking after the women and girls and
the horses and goods in the camp. But Ezra
Winship went with Boone and his men, and this
following of the red men’s trail resulted in the
downfall of two more Indians and the taking
prisoner of the chief, Red Feather, who had been
wounded at the very start of the fight.</p>

<p>In the battle four of the whites had been
wounded and one man—a very old frontiersman
named Hollenbeck—was killed. The wounds of
those hurt were not serious and were dressed with
care by the women and girls who had been rescued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>It was a long story that Cora Winship had to
tell concerning her captivity, but it need not be
repeated here, for it is very similar to hundreds
of such stories which have already been told.
The Indians had treated her with alternate kindness
and harshness, and she had been given to
understand that she was to be taken to some Indian
village far to the northward, along one of
the lakes.</p>

<p>“I do not know what has become of mother
or of Harmony,” she said.</p>

<p>“Harmony is safe at the fort,” answered Joe.
“Do you know what has become of Clara Parsons?”</p>

<p>“I do not, Joe. We were together at first, but
the Indians soon separated us, just as they separated
Harmony from the others. So Harmony
is safe? Well, I am glad to learn that. But
poor dear mother!” And the girl shook her
head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>When Mr. Winship came back from the hunt
after the fleeing Indians Cora sprang into his arms
with a joyful cry. It was a happy moment for all
despite the fact that the mother and wife was
still missing.</p>

<p>The Indian chief, Red Feather, refused to talk
when brought in, nor would any threats induce
him to open his mouth.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“The palefaces may do as pleases them,” were
his words. “Red Feather, the mighty chief of
the Cherokees, has nothing to say to them.”</p>

<p>But one of the other Indians was not so close-mouthed,
and from this warrior it was learned
that the reason Paul Broker had been tortured
was because he had attacked and attempted to kill
Long Knife, Red Feather’s brother chief.</p>

<p>“Long Knife was in a canoe with a white
maiden when the paleface shot him with an
arrow,” said the Indian to Daniel Boone, in his
native language.</p>

<p>The old pioneer had heard Joe’s story, and he
quickly turned to the youth and told him what
the Indian said.</p>

<p>“That was not Paul Broker, but myself,” said
Joe.</p>

<p>“Ha! now we have the truth of it!” cried Paul
Broker, who was standing near. “I told the
redskins that I had done nothing of the kind, but
they would not believe me. In the darkness Long
Knife probably mistook Joe for myself.”</p>

<p>As the youth and the young man looked so
much alike, this was accepted as the true explanation
of the affair.</p>

<p>“It is lucky we came along as we did,” said
Joe to Paul Broker. “If we hadn’t you would
have suffered horribly on my account.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>None of the Indians could tell what had become
of Long Knife further than that he had appeared
at the camp badly wounded and that he had been
taken away by two warriors acting under Red
Feather’s orders.</p>

<p>“Red Feather and Long Knife are related,”
said Daniel Boone. “If either suffers the other
will do what he can to right the injury. Now
that Long Knife has escaped he will probably
keep shady until he is well again, and then he
will do what he can to cause us more trouble. But
I have a card I shall play against him.”</p>

<p>“You mean Red Feather?” said Ezra Winship.</p>

<p>“Yes. I shall keep him a captive and notify
the Indians for miles around the fort that if an
attack is made Red Feather shall suffer most horribly
for it, but if they keep the peace Red Feather
shall be released at the end of six months and be
given half a dozen best blankets and a fine horse.”</p>

<p>“But what will you do about my wife and the
others who are still missing?” asked Mr. Winship
anxiously.</p>

<p>At this Daniel Boone shook his head slowly and
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I hate to say it, friend Winship, but—but——”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“I am sorely afraid that all of the others who
were taken captives are dead,” answered Daniel
Boone.</p>

<p>“Do you really mean that?” cried Joe, with
a sinking heart.</p>

<p>“I do. I have tried my best to find some trace
of them, but there is none, and when a redskin
refuses to speak on that subject after talking
about all others it is pretty safe to say that the
truth is too awful to mention.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>SETTLING DOWN AT BOONESBOROUGH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with sorrowful hearts that Mr. Winship
and Joe accompanied the party under Colonel
Boone back to the fort. Even the presence of
Cora, who had always been the particularly bright
member of the family, did not serve to dispel the
gloom caused by the continued absence of Mrs.
Winship.</p>

<p>“I cannot believe that she is dead, father,” said
the young pioneer. “Such a fate would be horrible!”</p>

<p>“I am of the same mind, Joe,” answered Ezra
Winship. “Yet Colonel Boone has had a vast
experience with the red men, and he must know
what he is talking about.”</p>

<p>“The best of men make mistakes sometimes,”
put in Cora hopefully.</p>

<p>The party moved onward as fast as possible,
but with the women and girls along, as well as the
wounded and the goods recovered from the Indians,
it took twice the time to reach the fort as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
it had to ride from there to the encampment in
the valley.</p>

<p>Those at the fort saw them when yet a long
distance away, and Peter Parsons and Harry rode
out to meet the Winships.</p>

<p>“My Clara still missing!” groaned Mr. Parsons.
It was like a blow in the face to him.</p>

<p>“Yes, Peter, and my wife, too,” replied Ezra
Winship.</p>

<p>The news that Clara Parsons was still missing
was an added shock to the girl’s mother, and it
was several days before the Quakeress recovered
sufficiently to go about her duties.</p>

<p>“She must be dead, just as Colonel Boone
says!” moaned the stricken mother. “Oh, why
has this cross fallen upon us? Is it that we have
been so sinful?”</p>

<p>On his part, Harry said but little. But he felt
the loss as keenly as did anybody, for his sister
Clara had been his constant companion all his life,
and he loved her dearly.</p>

<p>But every period of mourning and lamenting
must have an end, and there was plenty to do for
all hands in Boonesborough.</p>

<p>“I think the best we can do is to get settled
down,” said Peter Parsons. “That will give my
wife and the girls something to do and keep their
mind off of this trouble. As soon as we are settled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
you and I, friend Winship, and Joe and
Harry, too, for that matter, can do our best to
find some trace of your wife and my Clara.”</p>

<p>“But they may be suffering at this moment,”
said Ezra Winship.</p>

<p>“I hardly think that. Now that the fight is
over, if they have not been killed, they are most
likely living quietly at some Indian village far
away.”</p>

<p>As already mentioned, Peter Parsons had selected
two sites for farms adjoining each other.
There was scarcely a choice between the two, and
to be perfectly fair in the matter Mr. Winship insisted
upon drawing lots to decide which should
be his and which Peter Parsons’.</p>

<p>It was decided that for the present only one
cabin should be built, as close to the fort as
possible, in which the Winships and the Parsons
might dwell together until the following summer.
This would keep Mrs. Parsons and the two Winship
girls together while the boys and their
fathers were away from home.</p>

<p>It was no easy task to fell the trees and build
such a cabin as was needed for the united families,
but the men and the boys went to work with
a will, and inside of several weeks the cabin was
finished in the rough. It was of logs and was
about fifteen feet deep by thirty feet long. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
interior was divided into a living room fifteen
feet square, and opening off of this were two bedrooms
of half that size. The living room boasted
of a door front and back and a window, and there
was also a window in each of the sleeping apartments.</p>

<p>No furniture of large size had been brought to
this settlement, and it was consequently necessary
to furnish the living room with a table built of a
rough slab and two benches of the wooden-horse
variety, commonly called puncheons. The floor
was likewise a puncheon floor, that, is, made of
the halves of a split log, the flat side smoothed
off. In the bedchambers a long low frame was
built, running parallel with the inner wall, and on
these the beds were placed, foot to foot, two in
each room.</p>

<p>The chimney of the cabin was rather a large
affair, built of rough stone and such mortar as the
settlers could make themselves. It was on the
side of the living room, directly between the two
doors opening into the bedrooms. Above the
open fireplace was a shelf and several hooks for
cooking utensils, and in the fireplace itself were
several chains and hooks upon which to hang pots
and other things. It may be added that the settlers
had brought with them half a dozen knives
and an equal number of spoons, cups, and plates.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Forks were hardly known in those days, and many
of the old pioneers preferred to cut their food
with their hunting knives.</p>

<p>After the woodwork of the cabin was finished,
the chinks were carefully plastered with a clayey
mud which soon hardened in the hot weather and
sunshine. In the meantime the women folks set
to work to place the interior in order with such
means as were at hand. Not many things had
been brought along, and of these a number were
still missing because of the Indian raid, and at
the proper time Mrs. Parsons and the girls would
have all they could do to spin, weave, or knit
towels, bed-linen, and clothing.</p>

<p>The hard work brought with it one blessing.
It took the minds of the workers from their sorrow,
and had it not been for that one dark cloud
all of the party would have been very happy.</p>

<p>“It’s an ideal spot for a home,” said Ezra
Winship more than once. “I doubt if a better
can be found anywhere.”</p>

<p>“I thought the soil amazingly rich,” answered
Peter Parsons, “and the things that have been
planted prove it. Everything is growing nicely.”</p>

<p>In those days a man could live only by what he
planted and by what he hunted and fished, and,
although no wheat or corn was sown that season
by the Winships and the Parsons, a small tract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
of land was cleared and here the precious seeds
of numerous kinds of vegetables were planted,
peas, beans, onions, carrots, parsnips, turnips, as
well as squashes, pumpkins, and the like, and
some cuttings of vines which had been brought
along.</p>

<p>One day a week was spent in hunting and fishing,
the two boys going out one week and the
two men folks the next.</p>

<p>“I saw the track of a number of deer this morning,”
said Harry to Joe, on a Friday before the
Saturday on which the pair were to go out and
try their luck. “I wish we could spot some of
’em to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Where did you see them, Harry?” questioned
Joe with interest, for he was as anxious to
add some venison to the home larder as was his
chum.</p>

<p>“Up that little side stream, near the fallen walnut.
I was up there after some sassafras and
birch, and I counted at least six tracks leading
from the turn of the brook.”</p>

<p>“We ought to go down early and try our luck
with them.”</p>

<p>“Just what I was thinking. We ought to get
on the ground before sun-up.”</p>

<p>The boys spoke to their parents about going
away early and, receiving consent, set to work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
that evening at cleaning and oiling up the two
rifles to be taken along, and also arranging their
fishing lines, for they did not intend to rely upon
hunting entirely to fill the household larder.</p>

<p>It was not yet four o’clock when Joe pinched
Harry’s arm and awoke him. Silently, so as not
to awaken the other sleepers, the boys slipped into
their clothing and went into the living room.</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Parsons had left a cold breakfast
for them, and this they swallowed with all speed.
Then, with a drink of water to wash down the
food, they took up their weapons and their lines
and sallied forth in the early dawn.</p>

<p>The grass was heavy with dew and the early
morning birds were just beginning to pipe up
when they passed out of sight of the cabin and
along the tiny brook Harry had mentioned.
They walked with caution and when they spoke
it was in a whisper.</p>

<p>“The wind is just right,” said Harry. “If
it was blowing the other way they’d spot us before
we so much as caught a sight of ’em.”</p>

<p>As they drew closer to the spot where Harry
had seen the tracks they moved with increased
caution and finally threw themselves down in the
grass and wormed along behind some low bushes
and rocks.</p>

<p>When Harry had gained a position he considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
just right he halted and motioned for Joe
to do the same. Each examined his rifle to make
certain it was ready for use, and then each set his
gaze on a spot which Harry indicated with his
finger to his chum.</p>

<p>A half-hour went by, and there was no sight
of a deer or anything else coming down to the
brook. But these young pioneers had learned the
value of patience in hunting, and each remained
in his position without a word of complaint.</p>

<p>Ten minutes more and Joe saw something moving
in the bushes just above the spot his chum had
pointed out. It was a beautiful buck with graceful
antlers and a skin that shone finely in the
early dawn.</p>

<p>Slowly the buck came down to the water’s edge,
raising his head every few steps, and sniffing the
air suspiciously. Behind him came six deer, all of
fair size and all equally timid.</p>

<p>As the game came closer the boys’ hearts began
to thump madly within their bosoms. Never
had they seen such a fine collection of deer, and
never had they had a better chance to bring down
the game.</p>

<p>“Which will you take?” whispered Joe, when
he could remain silent no longer.</p>

<p>“I’d like to try for the buck, but——” Harry
hesitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“We’ll have to let him go, Harry. His meat
would be as tough as leather. Take the one next
to him, and I’ll take one further back.”</p>

<p>So it was agreed, and resting their long rifles
on the rocks in front of them the two young pioneers
took careful aim at the game.</p>

<p>“Ready, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Crack! crack! the two rifles spoke almost as
one piece, and as the echo arose on the air two of
the deer were seen to leap and shiver, and then
pitch over on their sides.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! we’ve got ’em both!” shouted Joe,
and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Let’s try for another,” answered Harry, and
pulling out an old pistol he had brought along he
aimed it at the big buck and fired.</p>

<p>His aim was only partly true, and the buck
was struck a glancing blow in the left foreleg.
He slipped down on his knees, but soon arose
again. In the meantime the unshot deer fled to
the forest with a speed that can better be imagined
than described.</p>

<p>While Harry was shooting at the buck Joe had
started to reload his rifle. Harry dropped his
empty pistol and pulled out his hunting knife,
thinking to rush in and cut the buck’s throat.</p>

<p>“Look out for him, or he’ll gore you!” yelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Joe, and his warning came none too soon, for just
then the buck leaped forward and rushed at Harry
with lowered antlers. The young pioneer knew
he could not withstand such a shock and leaped to
one side.</p>

<p>“He has got lots of fight in him yet, even if he
is clipped,” panted Harry, rushing to the top of
some rocks. “Look out for him, Joe!”</p>

<p>“I mean to look out,” was the answer, as Joe
continued to load with all possible speed.</p>

<p>The retreat of Harry caused the wounded buck
to pause for an instant. But it was only for an
instant; then his gaze turned to Joe, and with a
snort of rage he hopped rather than leaped forward,
as if to prod Joe to death on the spot.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>PERILS OF THE YOUNG HUNTERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a moment of extreme peril, and none
could have realized it better than did these two
young pioneers. They had often heard of the
rage of a wounded buck, and had heard of how
one old friend of Harry’s family had once been
gored to death in scarcely more time than it takes
to tell it.</p>

<p>“Run, Joe, run!” came from Harry. “Don’t
let him strike you!”</p>

<p>For one instant Joe had been of a mind to stand
his ground and finish the loading of his gun.
But now he saw that there would not be time in
which to prime the weapon, and he made a rush
behind some of the nearest bushes.</p>

<p>The buck came on and struck the bushes with
terrific force, almost reaching the youth in spite
of the thickness of the growth. Joe leaped further
back and then ran for the rocks upon which Harry
was standing.</p>

<p>“He means business, doesn’t he?” the young
pioneer gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Yes, and you want to look out for his
prongs,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>He, too, had been trying to reload his gun, but
had not as yet been able to attend to the
priming.</p>

<p>Again the buck turned, and, having disentangled
himself from the bushes, rushed toward
the rocks.</p>

<p>“Jump!” called Joe, and made a leap to the
ground in the rear.</p>

<p>Instead of doing as his chum had done, Harry
made a leap for a nearby tree and caught hold of
one of the bottom branches. His weight, however,
proved to be too much for the branch,
and it sagged down to within four feet of the
ground.</p>

<p>Once on the rocks the buck stared at first one
boy and then the other, as if trying to decide
which he should attack first. Then he saw Harry
clutching the branch, and made a leap straight in
that direction.</p>

<p>But Harry was not to be caught thus easily,
and sliding around he faced the buck, still holding
on to the limb with both hands.</p>

<p>Again there was a rush, and this time, instead
of striking the bushes, the animal came pell-mell
into the end of the tree branch. There was a
quiver and a crash, and the branch snapped into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
pieces, hurling Harry backward almost against
the tree trunk.</p>

<p>The buck could easily have followed Harry to
the trunk, and have there finished him, but for
one reason, and that was, when the crash came a
part of the tree limb caught the animal directly in
the mouth. This is a sensitive part, even in an
old buck of the deer tribe, and the animal lost no
time in pulling back to clear himself of this new
difficulty.</p>

<p>But the buck still had his eye on Harry, and
rushing around the broken tree branch he prepared
for another plunge forward.</p>

<p>As soon as the animal turned from him to
Harry, Joe lost no time in finishing the loading
of his gun. With the weapon now properly
primed he leaped around to a position where he
could get a good shot at the buck.</p>

<p>Again the animal came forward, straight for
Harry, who, in trying to leap to the opposite side
of the tree, had slipped and fallen.</p>

<p>Crack! It was Joe’s rifle that spoke up, and
this time the boy’s aim was all that could be desired.
The buck received the ball straight in the
heart and leaped high in the air. Down he came
with a crash, directly at Harry’s side and lay
still, stone-dead.</p>

<p>As the buck fell Harry tried to roll out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
way, thinking there might still be some life left
in the animal. Joe drew his hunting knife and
leaped in.</p>

<p>“Is he—he dead?” panted Harry.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was Joe’s slow answer. “That shot
fixed him.”</p>

<p>For fully half a minute both youths stood by
the side of the fallen game, surveying the animal
with interest. Harry was trembling slightly, and
Joe was several shades paler than his usual color.</p>

<p>“He’s a big one, isn’t he?” said Joe at length.</p>

<p>“Yes, Joe, and I reckon we both had a close
shave, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want another such fight, do you?”</p>

<p>“Not at quite such close quarters,” came from
Joe. He bent lower. “I must have taken him
right through the heart.”</p>

<p>“Three deer! What will the folks say to
that?”</p>

<p>“I reckon they’ll think it is something wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is wonderful for boys. I never heard
of it being done before. But don’t let us
brag.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, I hate bragging. But, say, let
us get home with the meat at once. Then, if we
want to, we can go fishing this afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>This plan was agreed on, and then came the
question of how best to get the deer home. All
told, there were several hundreds of pounds of
venison in the pile, no light load to be dragged a
distance of over a mile.</p>

<p>“Let us each take a deer on a drag at first,”
said Joe. “We can come back for the buck
later.”</p>

<p>“But some wild beast may make way with the
buck. We don’t want to lose him after all the
trouble we had in bringing him down.”</p>

<p>“Let us haul him up into the tree.”</p>

<p>They looked around, and close at hand found a
convenient limb, over which they threw a bit of
rope one of the boys had brought along. Soon
the buck was tied to the rope and hoisted a distance
of eight feet from the grass.</p>

<p>When this task was finished, the boys cut two
drags, and on the top of each fixed one of the
deer. Then both started for the cabin, each dragging
his load behind him.</p>

<p>The way was rough and long before the cabin
came into view, the boys were more than tired of
hauling the tree limbs with their dead weights
along. But the thought of how the good news of
the hunt would be received by their folks kept
them up, and at last they came in sight of the
home in the little clearing, and raised a shout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
which was at once answered by Ezra Winship,
who came from the kitchen, gun in hand.</p>

<p>“Well, by the great pewter candlestick!” cried
Mr. Winship. “Is it possible! Two deer, and
each as plump as one would wish. You’ve certainly
had luck, boys.”</p>

<p>The shouting now brought Mr. Parsons from
a neighboring bit of brush, and Mrs. Parsons and
the girls from the house, and all gazed in admiration
at the game.</p>

<p>“How many shots for each?” questioned Mr.
Parsons.</p>

<p>“Only one for each,” answered Harry proudly.
“Joe brought down that one, and I brought down
this.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done well, lads, mighty well—in fact,
no old hunters could do better.” And Peter Parsons’
face showed his pleasure.</p>

<p>“How many deer were there?” asked Ezra
Winship.</p>

<p>“Six, and a magnificent old buck,” answered
Joe.</p>

<p>“Oh, why didn’t you try for the buck?” cried
Harmony. “I’d like to have a pair of prongs for
your coats and hats to hang on.”</p>

<p>“The deer meat is best,” said Mrs. Parsons.
“’Tis likely to be very sweet and tender.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we got the old buck after all,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Joe, and he could scarcely disguise the tone of
triumph in his voice.</p>

<p>“Got the buck?” came from the lad’s father
and several of the others.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Harry. “Joe shot him right
through the heart.”</p>

<p>“But not until Harry had wounded him in the
leg with a pistol shot,” came quickly from Joe.</p>

<p>And then the two boys had to tell the particulars
of the brief hunt. But they did not tell how
closely they had been in danger of death, being
afraid that if they told all they might be kept from
going on another hunt in the future.</p>

<p>“Boys, you are regular hunters and no mistake,”
said Peter Parsons warmly. “Three at
once! Winship, it is wonderful!”</p>

<p>“You are right,” answered Ezra Winship.
“These deer are of good size, and from what they
say of the buck he must have been in his prime.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have the hat and coat rack after
all,” said Harmony brightly.</p>

<p>“And three good rugs in addition,” came from
Cora.</p>

<p>Neither Mr. Parsons nor Mr. Winship advised
letting the buck hang in the tree too long, and
both volunteered to go after the game. But the
boys preferred to go after it themselves, after
they had had a short rest. While they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
resting, Mrs. Parsons treated them to some fresh
sugared corn cookies she had just made, while
Cora brought them each a glass of nice birch beer
of their own make. In those days beer made of
birch, spruce, and various roots was a common
drink.</p>

<p>Leaving their fathers to dress and cut up the
venison brought in, Joe and Harry set out on the
return to the hunting ground. Neither expected
to see any more game that day, yet each had
loaded his gun, and Harry his pistol in addition,
and the weapons were carried in such a fashion
that they could be brought into use at short notice
if required.</p>

<p>“If we go fishing this afternoon, I wonder if
we’ll have such luck as we had hunting,” remarked
Harry, as they strode forward in the
direction of the brook.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t expect too much good luck all
at once,” responded his chum with a short laugh.
“Besides, with so much meat we won’t want so
much fish.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never expect to bring down a larger buck,
shall you?”</p>

<p>“Hardly. Yet we are both young, and there is
no telling what luck we’ll have before we die.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” went on Harry, after a
pause. “What fine times we could have if only—if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> 
only my sister and your mother were with us.”
His voice sank low as he finished.</p>

<p>“Yes, Harry, whenever I think of them it
takes the fun right out of everything,” answered
Joe; and then both boys heaved a long sigh.</p>

<p>“If we only knew where to look for them.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. But father is going on a hunt soon,
with your father and old Pep Frost and some
others. Let us hope they’ll get news of some
kind.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of Pep Frost puts me in mind of
some news he brought in yesterday. He says that
things are getting hot down Boston way between
the citizens and King George’s officials, and
almost everybody is speaking of war. I wonder
if it will really come to that?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised. What is the use of
our paying taxes if we aren’t to get anything for
doing it? I think we ought to be allowed to run
this country as we please.”</p>

<p>“If war comes it may make more trouble out
here. The French and the Indians who used to
train with them wouldn’t like anything better
than to give us a rub.”</p>

<p>“The French won’t do much—they are quite
friendly now. But it might be an excuse for
another Indian uprising. They hate it like poison
to see us occupying these lands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Colonel Boone says he is going to stick here
no matter what comes. And I reckon he’ll keep
his word.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll all stand by him. There is
nothing else to do. We are too far away from
any other fort to look for aid from such a quarter.
We’d have to fight to a finish.”</p>

<p>So talking, the two boys hurried on through
the woods and along the brook where the deer
had first been sighted. The sun was now fairly
high in the heavens, and the day promised to be
an unusually warm one.</p>

<p>At last they reached the tree from which the
carcass of the big buck had been suspended. Both
stared up into the branches in wide-eyed amazement.</p>

<p>The carcass of the buck was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>ON THE TRAIL OF A THIEF</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> buck is gone!”</p>

<p>It was Joe who gasped out the words, after
several seconds of painful silence.</p>

<p>“Yes, but to where?” came from Harry.
“That meat didn’t walk off by itself.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps some wild animal carted it away,
Harry.”</p>

<p>“If so, it was a pretty big animal, and we had
best look out for our own hides, Joe.”</p>

<p>Both looked around the spot, and up the brook,
but neither man nor beast was in sight.</p>

<p>As Joe continued to look around the vicinity
Harry dropped on his hands and knees and examined
the damp ground under the tree.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” called out Joe.</p>

<p>“Here are plenty of footprints,” was the slow
reply. “But perhaps they are only our own.”</p>

<p>Joe came closer, and some of the footprints
were followed out of the tangle in the shade.
Then Joe uttered a cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“Harry, we didn’t come in this direction, and
those marks are neither yours nor mine.”</p>

<p>“You are right. See, they lead along behind
these bushes and then directly into the brook.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they move up the brook, too!”</p>

<p>“It was a two-legged thief who ran away with
our game!”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it was an Indian or a white
man?”</p>

<p>“I really can’t say. I haven’t seen an Indian
here since that fellow called Yellow Blanket
called on Colonel Boone. And who of the settlers
around here would be mean enough to take
our game is more than I can surmise. But I know
one thing.”</p>

<p>“And that is——”</p>

<p>“I’m going after the chap in double-quick
order.”</p>

<p>“I am with you. We are two to one and well
armed. I suppose he didn’t think we would come
back so soon.”</p>

<p>“More than likely.”</p>

<p>Just above the spot where the deer had been
shot, the brook widened out and became more or
less of a shallow stream, with here and there a
dirt instead of a stone bottom. Bending low they
could, by the aid of the strong sunlight, occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
catch sight of a footprint where the thief had
missed his footing from one stone to the next.</p>

<p>“He would have kept to the stones entirely,
and thus cut off his trail,” said Joe; “but his load
was almost too much for him. And by that same
token, I imagine he won’t go very far before he
sits down to rest.”</p>

<p>“If that is so, we may be close to him already.
Perhaps we had best keep quiet, and keep our
eyes wide open.”</p>

<p>After that but little was said, and each youth
kept his ears on the alert. The brook now ran
upward, and consisted of a series of tiny waterfalls.
Just ahead were a series of rocks.</p>

<p>As they approached the rocks, Joe, who was in
advance, held up his hand as a warning. Then he
crawled forward as noiselessly as a ghost, and
looked over the top of the rocks.</p>

<p>On a fallen tree he saw an Indian resting, with
the carcass of the buck beside him. The warrior
was Yellow Blanket, the red man who had called
on Daniel Boone at the fort about a week before,
bringing a message for Red Feather, which,
however, had not, by Boone’s order, been delivered.</p>

<p>Yellow Blanket was alone, and was evidently
getting ready to continue his journey. He had
been carrying the buck across his shoulders, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
his bow and arrows were slung over his breast
so as not to interfere with his load.</p>

<p>By signs Joe gave Harry to understand that
both should cover the red man with their guns,
and this was done without delay. The two young
pioneers leaped on the rocks and confronted the
Indian.</p>

<p>Yellow Blanket had been in a contemplative
mood, not dreaming that he would be thus
quickly followed up. He started in amazement,
and leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>“Raise your hands!” called out Joe, as one
hand of the enemy went toward the tomahawk at
his belt. “Raise ’em or I’ll fire!”</p>

<p>“And so will I fire!” added Harry.</p>

<p>The Indian understood very little English, but
the truth of the situation was plain to him, and
letting go of the tomahawk he spread out his arms
wide, as if to show a friendly spirit. Then the
youths came closer, each keeping the Indian still
covered.</p>

<p>“So you thought you would run off with our
meat, eh?” questioned Joe sharply.</p>

<p>The Indian looked blankly at them and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Yellow Blanket cannot speak the tongue of
the paleface,” he said in his own language.</p>

<p>“This is our game,” went on Joe, and still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
keeping his gun leveled with one hand, he took
the other and pointed first at the dead buck and
then at himself and Harry.</p>

<p>Again the Indian shrugged his shoulders, and
then shook his head slowly. At last he pointed
to a tree, and then at himself, and then at Joe and
Harry, and shook his head.</p>

<p>“He means to say he found it in a tree, and
didn’t know it belonged to us,” said Harry.
“Well, that’s the truth, I suppose, but it wasn’t
his game, even so.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do with the fellow, Harry?
We can’t shoot him down in cold blood, and it
wouldn’t do much good to march him back to
the fort.”</p>

<p>“Well, take his arrows from him, and march
him off about his business, Joe. That’s the best I
can think of.”</p>

<p>While Joe kept the Indian covered with his
gun Harry strode forward and made the fellow
give up eight fine arrows he carried. The bow
he let the red man retain, since it would be useless
until he could provide more arrows for it.</p>

<p>To show that they did not take the arrows for
their own use, Harry broke the shafts over his
knee. This caused the Indian to scowl deeply,
but he said nothing.</p>

<p>“Now march, and don’t you turn around to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
look back,” said Joe, and he pointed up the brook
beyond the rapids. Yellow Blanket understood,
and with downcast countenance walked off.</p>

<p>They watched him out of sight, and then, without
loss of time, picked up the buck between them
and hurried towards home, but not by the route
they had previously traveled.</p>

<p>“That Indian may take it into his head to come
back on the sly,” said Joe. “We don’t want to
run the risk of having our heads split open by his
tomahawk.”</p>

<p>“We can keep an eye to the rear and on both
sides,” answered his chum, and this was done, but
Yellow Blanket failed to reappear, probably
thinking that one Indian with only a tomahawk
was no match for two strong-looking youths with
guns and hunting knives.</p>

<p>When the boys got back and told of the adventure
with the Indian, both Mr. Winship and
Mr. Parsons said it would not be advisable for
them to go out fishing that afternoon.</p>

<p>“There may be more Indians in the neighborhood,”
said Ezra Winship. “And if there
are, it won’t do for you to run unnecessary
risks.”</p>

<p>It was thought best to report the occurrence to
Colonel Boone, and Joe walked over to the fort
for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>In those days, the fort at Boonesborough was a
rude but strong one. It was about two hundred
and sixty feet in length by about one hundred and
fifty feet in width, with one corner resting on the
bank of the river. It had a strong stockade of
pointed timbers planted deeply into the ground,
and a similar stockade ran around most of the
cabins occupied by those who had first come westward
with Daniel Boone, so that they were in
close communion with the fort proper. Inside of
the main stockade were several log cabins, and
a shelter for ammunition and another for garrison
stores.</p>

<p>Joe found Daniel Boone at work writing a letter
to one of the superior officers of the land company
which he represented, telling of what had
recently happened at the settlement, and what he
thought the Indians would do next.</p>

<p>“So Yellow Blanket is still sneaking around
this vicinity,” said the great hunter, on hearing
the youth’s tale. “I am glad that you and young
Parsons sent him about his business.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he will harm us further?”
asked the young pioneer.</p>

<p>“It is not likely, Winship. Yellow Blanket is
a cur, nothing more. If he strikes at all it will be
in the dark. I will send out Pep Frost and Raystock
to see if they cannot capture him. A month<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
of captivity will make him glad enough to shake
the dust of this vicinity from his feet.”</p>

<p>Pep Frost, who was close at hand, was called in.
Joe had not seen this old hunter for some time,
and the two were glad to meet again.</p>

<p>“What! You an’ Harry got two deer an’ an
old buck one trip?” he ejaculated. “By hemlock!
but it won’t be no ust fer us old fellows to
go out no more; eh, colonel?”</p>

<p>“It’s the air that is doing it,” returned Daniel
Boone with a laugh. “Such purity can’t help
but make a good shot and a good trailer out of
most anybody.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bring in Yellow Blanket ef I kin,” said
Pep Frost. “But he’s a cur, as the colonel says,
an’ more’n likely he’s lit out long ago fer his wigwam.”</p>

<p>When Joe returned home he found Harry hard
at work dressing the deer skins, and he went to
work to fix up the head and antlers of the buck,
so that they might be hung up in the living room
for a coat and hat rack, as Harmony had suggested.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, it had been a hot day,
and when the sun went down it was hardly any
cooler. There was scarcely a breath of air stirring,
and, as a consequence, scarcely anybody felt
like retiring to the rather stuffy bedchambers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
the log cabin until sleep could no longer be put
off.</p>

<p>As tired as he was, Harry could not sleep until
long after he had gone to bed. He lay with Joe,
and he rather envied his chum, who slept peacefully.
When at last Harry did go to sleep he
dreamed of shooting deer, and of being gored by
the big buck, and about an hour later he awoke
with a start and dripping with perspiration.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a dream!” he murmured to himself,
and sat bolt upright, he could not tell why.</p>

<p>Joe still slept, and so did the youth’s father and
Ezra Winship, who occupied the second bed in
the room. From outside the faint rays of the
old moon cast a dim light into the room.</p>

<p>Feeling thirsty, Harry resolved to go out to
the living room for a drink. Not to awaken the
others, he crawled from the bed as silently as possible,
and tiptoed his way to the other part of the
cabin.</p>

<p>The water in the crock was warm and stale,
and having tasted of it Harry spit it out into the
fireplace.</p>

<p>“I’ll go out to the spring and get a fresh drink.
The air will do me good,” he reasoned, and tiptoeing
his way back to the bedchamber he slipped
on his outer garments for that purpose.</p>

<p>As he made his way to the living room door he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
saw a shadow glide over the floor, as if something
had come in between the rays of the moon and
the window close at hand. He looked up, but on
the instant the shadow was gone.</p>

<p>Harry stopped short and caught his breath.
Was he half asleep still, or had somebody really
passed the window? Several times he asked himself
that question, but could frame no satisfactory
answer.</p>

<p>“I’ll soon make sure,” he murmured, and
reached for his gun, which at night was laid on
a shelf, loaded and primed for immediate use.</p>

<p>As he caught up the weapon a scraping sound
from outside reached his ear. Then came a flare
of light through a crack between the cabin logs,
and like a flash he realized the truth.</p>

<p>Some enemy was outside, and was on the
point of setting the cabin on fire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>FIGHTING THE FLAMES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Stop</span>, you rascal, stop!”</p>

<p>Such was Harry’s exclamation as he saw the
flare of fire and realized what the person outside
of the log cabin was bent upon doing.</p>

<p>He knew that the cabin was dry from the hot
sun of the day before, and that the timber, once
started, would burn like tinder. Moreover, he
knew that to obtain sufficient water to put out
such a conflagration would be difficult.</p>

<p>Without stopping to think of possible peril, he
leaped for the door and threw it open.</p>

<p>In the dim moonlight he made out the form of
a man running across the dooryard to the nearest
patch of timber.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he called loudly. “Stop, or I will
fire on you!”</p>

<p>Instead of heeding the command the fellow
ran faster than ever.</p>

<p>Up came Harry’s gun, and, taking a low aim
at the retreating form, he fired. A yell of pain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
followed, and he saw the man stagger and fall
headlong.</p>

<p>By this time the cabin was in an uproar, and
Ezra Winship and Peter Parsons came rushing
from the bedroom, followed by Joe, and all
leaped for their guns, thinking that an attack by
the Indians had been begun. A moment later the
girls and Mrs. Parsons followed, wrapped in such
garments as had been handy.</p>

<p>“Harry, who are you firing at?” demanded
the youth’s father.</p>

<p>“Some rascal who set the cabin on fire,” was
the answer. “Quick, get some water, or the place
will be burnt down!”</p>

<p>The others now saw the fire, which was burning
fiercely in a heap of pine brush stacked against
the side of the cabin. Rushing for a pitchfork,
Ezra Winship threw the burning brush away
from the building.</p>

<p>While this was being done Mr. Parsons and
Joe hurried for buckets of water from the spring.
They had to work lively, for the flames were
creeping up the whole side of the log cabin
toward the highly inflammable roof.</p>

<p>“The house will be burnt down!” screamed
Cora, while Harmony wrung her hands in mute
despair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons was more practical, and, catching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
up a blanket, she saturated it in a pail of
water, and then began to beat out some of the
flames with this.</p>

<p>A few minutes of energetic work and the
danger was over. But the smoke filled the cabin,
and all the windows and the two doors had to be
opened wide to clear the interior.</p>

<p>While this was being done, Harry, having
slipped on some of his clothes, ran forward to
where the unknown had fallen. He was followed
by his father.</p>

<p>As they neared the spot they saw that the intruder
was limping away, casting anxious glances
backward as he did so.</p>

<p>“Come back here!” cried Harry, raising his
gun once more. “Come back here, or I’ll give
you another shot.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing this threat the unknown hesitated
for an instant. Then he dove into the
bushes.</p>

<p>But Harry and Peter Parsons were too quick
for the evildoer, and in a moment more they were
beside him, and each had a gun pointed at the fellow’s
head.</p>

<p>“Yellow Blanket!” exclaimed the young pioneer.
“I suspected as much.”</p>

<p>“Is this the redskin who tried to rob you of the
buck?” questioned Mr. Parsons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“The same, father. He got mad because Joe
and I stopped him, and because we took his arrows
away and broke them up. He was going to
revenge himself by burning down our cabin.”</p>

<p>At these words Yellow Blanket scowled, but to
them he made no reply. Indeed, having been
caught red-handed, as the saying is, it was impossible
for him to make any defense.</p>

<p>The Indian had been wounded in the right
thigh, and was undoubtedly suffering much pain.
Regardless of this, however, he was made to
march back to the cabin and a rope was brought
forth.</p>

<p>“We ought to shoot him on the spot, and have
done with the viper,” said Ezra Winship. “But
we’ll be a little more merciful and merely make
him a prisoner. In the morning we can lay the
case before Colonel Boone.”</p>

<p>The shot and the fire had aroused a number of
the neighbors, and soon several came to the place
to learn the trouble. When they heard of Yellow
Blanket’s actions they were thoroughly enraged,
and a number wanted to kill the Indian immediately,
but Ezra Winship told them of what he had
decided to do, and there the matter rested.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone came over himself at dawn, having
just learned of the affair.</p>

<p>“It was a dastardly piece of business,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
the great hunter. “And I must say I didn’t think
it of Yellow Blanket. He is a cur, but not so
cowardly as I imagined. We will march him
over to the fort and see what he has to say for
himself.”</p>

<p>Colonel Boone’s orders were carried out, and
the Indian was subjected to a rigid examination,
lasting fully an hour.</p>

<p>At first Yellow Blanket would not talk, but
when he was given to understand that he might
suffer death for his crime he shrank back with
fear.</p>

<p>Then he begged Boone to spare him, and intimated
that he could tell a great deal concerning
the raid on the late expedition to Boonesborough
if the great hunter would promise him his life and
his liberty.</p>

<p>At first Daniel Boone was not inclined to
listen to the rascal, but he remembered how
anxious Ezra Winship was concerning the whereabouts
of Mrs. Winship, and how much the Parsons
were worried over the loss of Clara Parsons,
and he at last consented to be easy on the Indian
provided he would tell the plain truth.</p>

<p>“And remember,” he said, “I shall not let you
go until I have proved your words.”</p>

<p>Yellow Blanket then went into many details
of the late raid. He said that the news of the expedition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
had been brought in by Long Knife, and
that it was this chief who induced Red Feather
to join in an attack on the whites. Long Knife
was particularly anxious to carry off some pretty
white maiden whom he might make his squaw.
After the fight he had tried to carry off Harmony
Winship, but she had been rescued, and Long
Knife had been seriously wounded by some white
person, the Indian had supposed was Paul Broker,
but who, later on, proved to be Joe Winship, as
already related.</p>

<p>“And what has become of Mrs. Winship and
Clara Parsons?” questioned Daniel Boone.
“And of the other captives?”</p>

<p>“They are at the lodges of Long Knife, Leaping
Waters, and Elk Head,” answered Yellow
Blanket. “But remember, the great hunter has
promised not to tell anybody that Yellow Blanket
revealed this,” he added.</p>

<p>“Where are those lodges located?” went on
Boone.</p>

<p>At this Yellow Blanket described the spot as
best he could. It was a place entirely new to Colonel
Boone, and one not yet visited by any of
the settlers at Boonesborough.</p>

<p>“How long do they expect to stay at the
lodges?” was Boone’s next question.</p>

<p>Yellow Blanket could not answer definitely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
but said he supposed they would remain there
during the winter, at least.</p>

<p>After the examination, the news the Indian had
imparted was told to Ezra Winship and Peter
Parsons.</p>

<p>“If you wish you may head an expedition
against the Indians,” said Daniel Boone. “I
would go myself, but at present that is impossible.
More settlers are coming in every day, as you can
see, and Colonel Henderson is anxious to open a
regular land office and form a permanent local
government.”</p>

<p>What Boone said about new settlers was true.
Nearly every day some pioneers came straggling
in, and once or twice a month a body of six or
eight families would appear. These settlers located
at various points, but all looked to the fort
at Boonesborough for aid in time of peril. A government
was formed, which, though crude, succeeded
in preserving some sort of law and order.
Various officers were elected, but the majority of
the settlers looked to Boone as their most reliable
leader, especially when dealing with the ever-present
Indian question.</p>

<p>From Yellow Blanket it was learned that the
Indians under Long Knife and the other chiefs
now amounted to perhaps a hundred all told. Of
these less than thirty were full-fledged warriors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the balance being women, children, and old men
incapable of fighting.</p>

<p>“Fifteen or twenty good shots ought to be
able to whip them, and whip them well,” said
Ezra Winship to Peter Parsons.</p>

<p>“I believe you,” answered Mr. Parsons.
“And if we can get together that many pioneers
I am willing to go out with you and see if we cannot
rescue my daughter and your wife, and also
the other captives.”</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to find so many good
shots willing to enlist for the venture. Those
who had members of their families missing were
eager enough, but others held back, saying that
they must remain at home to protect their own
folks and provide food for the coming fall and
winter. Many had not yet built their cabins, having
lived during the summer under tents, and
these felt that their first duty was to provide suitable
shelters against the snow and cold weather
that was coming.</p>

<p>“We should have started sooner, when the feeling
against the redskins was more bitter,” said
Peter Parsons. “Now the folks have grown accustomed
to what has been, and it doesn’t look so
cruel to them.”</p>

<p>But he and Ezra Winship persisted, and at last
they gathered together seventeen men who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
willing to undertake the trip. Of this number,
four were men who had lost various members of
their families by death during the raid, five, including
Mr. Winship and Mr. Parsons, wanted
to find, if possible, relatives who were lost, and
the others went merely from a sense of duty, or
for the excitement.</p>

<p>“We’ll teach ’em a lesson they won’t forgit in
a hurry,” said old Pep Frost, who was of the
number. “We’ll come down on ’em like a reg’lar
hurricane, hear me!” The prospect just suited
this man, and he went around whistling gayly as
though getting ready for a pleasure outing.</p>

<p>Joe and Harry had both begged hard for permission
to go along, but their fathers would not
listen to their pleadings.</p>

<p>“I know you are brave enough to go, Joe,”
said Mr. Winship. “But I want you to remain
behind and look out for Cora and Harmony.”</p>

<p>“And you, Harry, must look after your
mother,” put in Peter Parsons. “And, besides,
both you boys want to prepare all the food you
can for the long winter that will soon be on us.
If by some cause we do not get back as soon as expected,
we don’t want anybody here to starve to
death.”</p>

<p>“Ah, husband, if thee will take good care of
thy body we will take care of ours,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Mrs. Parsons. “And the same to thee, friend
Winship.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try to come back safe and sound,” answered
Mr. Parsons. “And, God willing, we will
bring back the lost ones with us.”</p>

<p>The last night together in the log cabin was a
sober one. Mrs. Parsons, a truly good woman,
insisted on holding a Quaker meeting, and she
and her husband prayed most earnestly for all
present, that they might pass through the coming
months unharmed, and might at last come together
again with the lost ones with them.</p>

<p>The expedition started at sunrise. Joe and
Harry saw them a mile or more on the way. Then
came a final handshake, and the expedition continued
on its way to the northwestward, while
the two young pioneers turned back toward the
log cabin, never dreaming of all that was to happen
ere they should see their fathers again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE FALL OF A HICKORY TREE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the departure of Ezra Winship and Peter
Parsons, affairs at the log cabin took on a more
sober look than ever. Although but little was
said on the subject all felt that the expedition that
had been undertaken was a most serious one.
Should the pioneers be led into ambush by the
Indians it might be that not one of them would
come back to tell the tale.</p>

<p>But with so much work to be done, the boys
had no time for idle speculation. They felt the
responsibility that had been thrust upon them, and
they determined to do their duty to the best of
their ability.</p>

<p>The first work at hand was to gather in what
remained of the somewhat scanty summer harvest.
This was comparatively easy work, and the young
pioneers were at it early and late.</p>

<p>During those days they were not without
alarms, and on two occasions left the field to join
the others at the fort. But one alarm was entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
false, and the other made by two drunken
red men who were easily subdued, so there was no
serious trouble.</p>

<p>After the last of the vegetables had been
brought in and stored away, and the pease and
beans dried, the boys turned their attention to
firewood, and day after day found them at the
edge of the clearing, hewing down the trees
which were to keep them warm during the winter,
and were also to help enlarge the fields which in
the future were to produce the best of garden
truck, as well as corn and rye.</p>

<p>Each boy was skillful with his ax, and they
often wagered between themselves as to which
could bring down a tree first. Sometimes the
girls or Mrs. Parsons would come out to watch
them for a brief spell, but usually these persons
had all they could do in and around the cabin,
where they were constantly spinning and weaving,
knitting and sewing, on the various garments
necessary for the approaching winter.</p>

<p>One day, when the boys were hard at work
cutting down two tall hickory trees, a messenger
rode into Boonesborough with news of the expedition
that had gone forth. At once the lads
dropped their axes and ran after the man to learn
what he might have to tell.</p>

<p>“We have not seen the regular body of Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
yet,” said the messenger. “But we met
three redskins on a river about a hundred miles
west of here. Two of ’em were shot down
in the fight, and the third man captured. He
didn’t want to talk at first, but later on he thought
better of it, and promised to lead us to Long
Knife’s hang-out.”</p>

<p>The messenger had come in to have a wound
in the shoulder attended to, and to obtain two
more rifles and some special ammunition. He
spent two days at Boonesborough, and during
that time Joe and Harry learned from him that
Mr. Winship and Mr. Parsons were as well as
ever, and that they had great hopes of the ultimate
success of the march against the enemy.</p>

<p>“They are moving rather slowly,” said Joe.
“Do you know what I am inclined to think?
That neither father nor the others want to attack
the Indians until they have gone into winter
quarters.”</p>

<p>“Well, if they do that, it’s more than likely
they will catch the redskins off their guard,” answered
Harry. “As a general thing an Indian
don’t care to fight in the winter.”</p>

<p>It was not until the day following that the two
young pioneers went to work to finish cutting
down the two hickory trees. Each was anxious
to have his tree fall first, and each worked away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
with vigor, making the broad chips fall in all directions.</p>

<p>“My tree is quivering!” cried Joe presently.
“She’ll be down in another five minutes, and I
know it!”</p>

<p>“Mine is coming too!” returned Harry, and
worked away with renewed energy. Although
they would not have admitted it, each youth was
highly excited over the prospect of winning the
novel race.</p>

<p>Harmony had come to the spring to get a
bucket of water, and now, seeing the tops of the
two tall trees quivering, she called Cora and Mrs.
Parsons to come out and see the sight.</p>

<p>“They are coming,” she announced. “And I
believe both are coming together.”</p>

<p>“I believe Harry’s is coming first,” said Cora,
after a keen glance at each shivering tree.</p>

<p>“Boys! boys!” called Mrs. Parsons from the
doorway of the cabin. “Be careful when they
come down!”</p>

<p>Neither of the youths heard the warning, for
each was chopping away madly. Then of a sudden
a chip flew up and hit Harry in the eye.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he cried. “Oh, I’m hit!”</p>

<p>“Where?” demanded Joe, and looked toward
his chum.</p>

<p>At that moment each tree began to come down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
with a mighty crack and a crash. Harry, holding
his hand to his scratched eye, managed to leap
out of the way of danger. But Joe, looking
toward the other tree, was taken for the moment
off his guard.</p>

<p>“Joe! Joe! jump!” screamed Harmony. “The
tree is coming down on your head!”</p>

<p>The young pioneer now realized his danger
and tried to leap away as bidden. But it was too
late, and in an instant more he was caught by one
of the tree limbs and pinned to the earth.</p>

<p>All who were looking on gave cries of horror,
and even Harry forgot that one of his eyes had
been scratched. He ran toward his chum with
all speed.</p>

<p>“Joe!” he called. “Joe, get up and out of the
way before the tree turns over on you!”</p>

<p>But Joe did not answer, for the reason that he
was almost senseless from the shock. Coming
closer, Harry saw that one of the branches of the
hickory lay directly across his throat, pinning him
down to the ground and strangling him!</p>

<p>“Is he—is he dead?” came from Harmony.
Her face was ghastly white.</p>

<p>“I—I hope not,” answered Harry. “But he
will be soon if I don’t get him free!”</p>

<p>Joe’s ax lay but a few steps away, and Harry
caught it up without delay. There was a grave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
peril there between the limbs of the hickory, for
the tree might turn over at any moment, carrying
Harry down under it, but just then Harry
gave no thought to this. His one idea was to
save Joe from strangulation.</p>

<p>But if Harry was brave, the girls and Mrs.
Parsons were equally so, and all rushed in to offer
what assistance they could. While they held the
limb as far up as possible Harry gave it a blow
or two with his sharp ax and then the branch
was bent back until it snapped and broke.</p>

<p>“Now out of the way, all of you!” panted
Harry, and caught Joe up in his arms.</p>

<p>The others leaped away from the tree and
Harry followed with his burden. Then the
hickory began to crack and groan, and in half a
minute more it rolled partly over into a slight
hollow and lay still.</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Harmony, after the tree had
stopped moving. “If—if Joe was under there
now he’d be smashed to a—a jelly!” And she
covered her face with her tier, or pinafore.</p>

<p>Harry had not stopped, but was on his way
to the spring. Here he laid Joe down and washed
his face with cold water. But it was several
minutes ere Joe gave a gasp and sat up, staring
around him.</p>

<p>“Oh, my neck!” were his first words, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
he added innocently: “Did the tree fall on
me?”</p>

<p>“That it did,” answered Mrs. Parsons, who
was kneeling beside him. “Thee can be thankful,
Joseph, that thy life has been spared to thee.”</p>

<p>“Some—something feels as if it had—had me
by the throat.”</p>

<p>“The tree had you by the throat,” said Harry,
and then, while Mrs. Parsons and the girls attended
to Joe, Harry bathed his bruised eye.</p>

<p>Fortunately for both boys neither was hurt
much by the double accident, but Joe felt rather
shaky when he got up on his legs.</p>

<p>“I reckon it was a narrow shave,” said he, and
added: “Harry, it was brave of you to jump in
and help me.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! you would have done the same for
me,” was the light answer.</p>

<p>“I see both the trees are down.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they came down exactly the same time—so
Cora says.”</p>

<p>“Then the wager is a tie, Harry. Well, I don’t
care, do you?”</p>

<p>“No. After this, I reckon we had best attend
to business and leave matches at tree-cutting
alone.”</p>

<p>It was not until the next day that the boys went
at the wood-cutting once more, and they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
careful to keep out of danger, and Harry was
especially careful as to where he let his chips fly
when chopping.</p>

<p>At the end of two weeks the boys had a large
pile of wood stacked up close to the rear door
of the cabin. This was made up mostly of tree
branches chopped and sawed into convenient
lengths for the open fireplace. The large tree-trunks
were left where they fell, to be cut up after
the sap was partly out of them and to be hauled
to the dooryard on a sled during the winter, when
the ground was covered with snow.</p>

<p>As long as there was good fishing the boys
spent one day a week at this sport, and always
managed to bring in a fine mess. By using the
fish Mrs. Parsons was able to economize with her
salt and smoked meats, which would give them
so much more food for the long winter months.</p>

<p>Before long the nights became nipping cold
and there was a heavy frost on the ground in the
morning. The frost opened the burs of the nuts
in the woods and the two young pioneers spent
two afternoons bringing in nuts of several
varieties, which were spread out on the flooring of
the cabin loft.</p>

<p>During the autumn Harry had located a bee
tree, and he was very anxious to find out what
amount of honey it contained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“Let us go out to-morrow after the honey,”
he said, one day.</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” answered Joe. “But we’ll
have to be careful, or the bees will sting us up
well.”</p>

<p>“If you go after that honey, you had best tie
some netting over your faces,” said Harmony;
and Mrs. Parsons said the same.</p>

<p>The tree was located nearly a mile from the
cabin, and the start was made from home just
as the sun was rising. Each of the young
pioneers carried his gun, and also a torch, thick
with pitch pine, and the netting already mentioned.</p>

<p>For some distance their walk took them along
the watercourse where they had brought down
the deer, but presently they turned to the left,
and plunged into a thicket where the trees grew
tall and straight, and where the brushwood was
of small account.</p>

<p>Boys less accustomed to the wilderness would
have become hopelessly lost in that thicket, but
Joe and Harry advanced with the utmost confidence,
for their many outings had made them
thoroughly acquainted with this bit of territory.</p>

<p>“Do you know, I really think the game is beginning
to thin out here,” remarked Harry, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
they trudged along. “I haven’t seen even a
rabbit so far.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is not to be wondered at, Harry—with
so many of the settlers out after the game
almost every day.”</p>

<p>“It would be a great pity if the game should
give out altogether.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that won’t happen for a good many
years. As the game grows more scarce, the old
hunters will drift elsewhere for shots, and that
will give the game here a chance to catch up
again.”</p>

<p>At last they came in sight of the bee tree, standing
in a little clearing by itself. The tree was not
as tall as those around it for which they were
thankful. It was hollow, and near the top flew
a few bees, basking idly in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Their work for the season is over,” remarked
Harry.</p>

<p>“It seems a pity to rob them of their store
of honey,” returned Joe. “But there is no help
for it—unless we want to go without.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t want to do that, Joe,” came
quickly from Harry, who had a great liking for
sweet things.</p>

<p>Putting down their guns, they brought forth
the nettings, and covered their faces and necks.
Then they slipped old mittens on their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“Now for the attack!” cried Joe, and brought
out his flint and tinder. He soon had a light,
and with this set fire to the pine torches.</p>

<p>Neither of the boys had ever smoked out bees
before, and they went at it in their own way.
At the bottom of the hollow tree was an opening,
and into this they thrust the lighted torches.</p>

<p>“Whoop! Here they come!” cried Joe, and
as he spoke a swarm of bees swept from the upper
portion of the hollow. Then came the thick
smoke and more bees—a swarm much larger
than they had anticipated.</p>

<p>“They are going to fight for their home!”
cried Harry, and he was right. Having emerged
from the smoke the bees swept around and around
the tree in a circle, and then swooped downward
upon the two young pioneers.</p>

<p>“Oh!” came in a yell from Joe, for he was
stung in the back of the neck, where the netting
failed to cover him.</p>

<p>“Oh!” answered Harry, stung in the left
hand, through a hole in his mitten. “Get away
from me!” he added. “Shoo! shoo!”</p>

<p>But the bees did not want to go away, and in
order to fight them off the boys pulled their
torches from the hollow tree and swung them
around their heads.</p>

<p>This soon made a dense smoke outside of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
tree, and the bees moved away, leaving some of
the ground burnt by the fire.</p>

<p>“Let us leave one torch in the tree, and defend
ourselves with the other,” said Harry.</p>

<p>This was done, and they continued to wave
the single torch around them, which made the
bees keep their distance. The smoke pouring
from the top of the tree brought forth more bees,
until they felt fairly certain that the hive within
was now totally deserted.</p>

<p>“The tree is catching fire!” exclaimed Joe
presently.</p>

<p>“So it is! That won’t do, Joe! Our honey
will be burnt up!” groaned Harry.</p>

<p>Here was a new difficulty, and, regardless of
more stings, Harry leaped toward the tree again,
and pulled away the torch. In the meantime Joe
ran for some water from a stream in that vicinity.
This was thrown up into the hollow by the aid
of a cup they carried, producing a denser smoke
than ever.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! the fire is out!” declared Harry,
five minutes later. “Oh, but wouldn’t I have been
mad if the honey had been burnt up!” he said.</p>

<p>“That smoke has driven away the last of the
bees,” announced Joe, after a careful look around.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure, Joe. My hand burns
worse than fire where I was stung!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“And how do you suppose my neck feels?
I’ve got a lump on it as big as a walnut. Those
bees meant business, I can tell you that.”</p>

<p>“So would you mean business, if you were
being smoked out of your home.”</p>

<p>They stood by the tree for quarter of an hour
longer, still letting the smoke ascend. Far
overhead they saw the bees circling around and
around, but at last they flew away to the westward,
in an almost solid swarm.</p>

<p>“They are all gone away now, and now we had
better get the tree down as soon as possible,” said
Joe.</p>

<p>Each had brought an ax along, and, sticking
the smoking torches into the ground close beside
them, they set to work with a will. The tree,
being hollow, fell an easy prey to their blows,
and soon it began to quiver, and then came down
in exactly the manner they expected.</p>

<p>“Down at last!” cried Harry. “Now to split
it open.”</p>

<p>Their experience at wood-cutting stood them
in good stead, and by being careful they managed
to split the tree from end to end without damaging
the honey-combs to any extent.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a fine haul!” came from Harry, as
he saw the combs. “How much do you think
is here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“Seventy-five or a hundred pounds, Harry.
Honey is pretty heavy stuff.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have a task getting it home.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. We got the deer home, and
we’ll get this home, too.”</p>

<p>A few bees were now coming back, and again
they had a fight, that lasted the best part of an
hour. But then the bees went off, and that was
the last they saw of them.</p>

<p>To get the honey home safely the boys cut a
number of withes, and of these formed a fairly
good basket, weaving the affair after the manner
of some Indians they had watched at work on
more than one occasion. This basket was placed
on a broad drag, and into it they put the honey.
Some honey, from the broken combs, was lost,
but this could not be helped.</p>

<p>“We should have brought a big kettle,” said
Joe. “Next time we will be wiser.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is, honey-bees are not located
every day, Joe. We may not see another for
years.”</p>

<p>Their success at honey gathering made them
light of heart, and both whistled merrily as they
hurried back to the cabin. They reached home
shortly after noon, and a shout brought Mrs.
Parsons and the girls out in a hurry to meet
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“Oh, but this is splendid!” cried Cora.
“We’ll have honey all winter!”</p>

<p>“’Tis truly good,” came from Mrs. Parsons.
“But there is more here than we need. We can
trade some with the neighbors for other things;”
and this was, later on, done.</p>

<p>With the coming of cold weather rabbit hunting
became extra good, and the boys would often
go out in the early morning and bring in enough
for a stew or a pot-pie. Each was now a skillful
marksman, and it was rarely that a shot was
wasted. Often they would bring in some other
small animal, as well as partridge and wild
turkeys.</p>

<p>During the autumn the inhabitants of Boonesborough
organized an expedition to search the
woods around the fort for some signs of the
Indians. But, though many miles of territory
were covered, no red men were brought to view,
and it was at last concluded that the Indians had
withdrawn to their winter quarters miles and
miles away.</p>

<p>“It’s a good work done if they have,” said
Harmony, when she heard the news. “I declare
I never want to see another Indian as long as I
live.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, Harmony, that wish won’t come
true,” said Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“Oh, I know it won’t.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind the Indians so much—if they
would be friendly.”</p>

<p>“I believe as Colonel Boone does,” put in
Harry. “A redskin can be trusted just so far
and no further.”</p>

<p>“And how far is that?” asked Cora.</p>

<p>“As far as you can see to watch him.”</p>

<p>It was a week later that the persons living in
the log cabin awoke to find the ground covered
with a heavy fall of snow. The snow was still
coming down, but it let up about noon and the sun
struggled through the clouds.</p>

<p>“That settles outside work for a while,” said
Joe. “All we can do is to fix up that sled and
haul in those big logs.”</p>

<p>“And go out for more deer, or for a bear,” answered
Harry.</p>

<p>“Right you are, Harry. I wish we could get
a bear—the skin would make a good cover for one
of the beds.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>AN ADVENTURE ON SNOWSHOES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys had talked bear for a long time—in
fact ever since they had heard of two other boys
of the settlement bringing in a pair of cubs they
had found in a hollow tree in the forest. They
had not said much in Mrs. Parsons’ presence, but
they had told the girls that they meant to get a
bear, big or little, before the winter was over.</p>

<p>At the fort they had fallen in with a French-English
trapper named Marquette. Marquette
was a happy-go-lucky fellow who loved hunting
and fishing better than he did eating and sleeping.
He was on good terms with everybody, and all of
the pioneers thought a good deal of him.</p>

<p>Marquette came to the log cabin one day bringing
in some sweet herbs that Mrs. Parsons desired
very much, and in return was given his supper and
a place to sleep. From this meeting the boys
were much interested in the hunter and he in the
boys.</p>

<p>“I will show you how to make snowshoes and
how to wear them,” he said one day. “Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
you can go anywhere, no matter how deep the
snow is.”</p>

<p>He was as good as his word, and when the
French-Englishman went away both Joe and
Harry were provided with a substantial pair of
snowshoes and had been out on them three times
and could use them fairly well.</p>

<p>It was about Christmas time that there came an
extra heavy fall of snow—for in those days the
snow fell heavier in Kentucky than it does to-day—why,
nobody can tell, exactly. Then followed
a day of thawing and then more cold weather, so
the surface of the snow was covered with a thick
crust.</p>

<p>“Just the thing for snowshoes!” cried Joe.
“We can travel almost anywhere and not break
through.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and a deer will break through at every
step and so will a bear,” returned Harry. “Just
the right snow for hunting.”</p>

<p>“If we can only find the deer and the bear.”</p>

<p>It took several days of hard talking on the part
of both boys to bring Mrs. Parsons and the girls
over to the point of letting them go off on a hunt
which was to last at least three days. But at last
the lady of the cabin learned from Colonel Boone
that there was no danger from Indians just then,
and she consented and the girls followed suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“But you must be sure and keep out of danger,
Joe,” said Cora.</p>

<p>“Yes, better let the bear go than have him eat
you up,” added Harmony.</p>

<p>“Thee must be very careful,” said Mrs. Parsons
to Harry. “Remember, with thy father
gone I rely much upon thee, my son.” And she
kissed him affectionately.</p>

<p>Each of the young pioneers went out provided
with a rifle and plenty of ammunition, a hunting
knife, and a tomahawk, and also a game bag containing
some provisions, and a tinder box with an
extra flint and steel. Their snowshoes were
donned in the living room, and everybody turned
out to see them off.</p>

<p>They had already decided in what direction to
strike out—up the brook where they had brought
down the two deer and the old buck. The watercourse
was now deeply covered with snow. They
walked on the top of this snow with care, determined
not to take a tumble while in sight of those
left behind.</p>

<p>Quarter of an hour’s walking took them around
a curve of the stream, and looking back they saw
that the homestead was no longer to be seen.</p>

<p>“Now we can strike out more boldly,” came
from Harry, and he did so, followed closely by
Joe. But their pride soon had a fall, and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
went down directly after the other, Joe forwards
and Harry backwards. There was a great floundering,
and several shrieks of laughter, and both
boys got up sadder and wiser.</p>

<p>“No use of talking, snowshoes are tricky
things,” said Joe. “The very moment you think
you are safe you aren’t at all.”</p>

<p>“We have got to get used to them, Joe. Remember,
Marquette has used snowshoes for years—probably
ever since he was a little boy.”</p>

<p>After this they walked on with more caution.
The day was a perfect one, the sun being clouded
just enough to take away the dazzling glare of
the snow’s crust. On every side arose the tall,
gaunt trunks of the leafless trees, with here and
there the tops of bushes and the sharp points of
windswept rocks.</p>

<p>As they advanced they kept their eyes open for
the appearance of game. The first thing to come
to view was a partridge sitting low on a hemlock.</p>

<p>“Don’t fire!” cried Joe, as Harry caught hold
of his gun.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“We are out for big game this trip, and if you
fire you may scare away something much better.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said Harry, and let the gun
down. “But it was a fine chance,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>“When a gambler plays for pounds he doesn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
mind the pennies, Harry. Come on after those
deer and that bear.”</p>

<p>The partridge flew away, and the landscape became
as lonely as before. At a great distance
they saw some birds circle in the air, but the game
did not pass anywhere near them.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t be afraid,” growled Harry,
“we are not going to harm a feather of you to-day.
Sir Joseph is after six deer and nine bear.”</p>

<p>“See here, Harry, do you want the birds?” demanded
Joe sharply; “if you do, blaze away.”</p>

<p>“No, Joe, I was only fooling. But I believe
the little beggars know we won’t hurt them, and
that is why they show themselves. If we wanted
birds or a partridge we wouldn’t see a feather of
either.”</p>

<p>“It is tantalizing, but we—oh!”</p>

<p>Joe’s talking came to a sudden end. He was
walking along a windswept ridge, where the surface
was covered with a thin icy snow. He had
taken a misstep and now he rolled over and over
into a hollow twenty or more feet deep. The
force of the tumble broke the crust of the snow,
and with a shout for help he suddenly disappeared
from view.</p>

<p>At first Harry was inclined to roar with laughter,
for it was a comical sight to see Joe go down,
head first, dragging the snowshoes after him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
But suddenly Harry’s mirth came to an end, for
Joe did not reappear as he had expected.</p>

<p>“Joe! Joe!” he called out; “Joe, what’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>No answer came back, and in increased alarm
Harry commenced to climb down into the hollow,
taking care, however, not to pitch over as his companion
had done.</p>

<p>When he reached the bottom he caught sight of
a snowshoe and began to pull upon it. This
nearly threw him over, but he continued to pull,
and presently uncovered one of Joe’s lower limbs.
Then Joe turned around, his head came up, and he
uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“Wouw!” came from his lips. “Gosh! I
thought I was going straight down to kingdom
come.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were buried alive,” returned
Harry.</p>

<p>The loose snow had gone down Joe’s back and
up his sleeves, and it took a deal of shaking to free
himself from a feeling that he declared was the
very opposite of comfortable. He got upon his
feet with difficulty, and then both boys wondered
how they were to get to the top of the ridge again.</p>

<p>“We can’t climb up here,” said Harry, in dismay.
“If we do we’ll both take a tumble.”</p>

<p>“Let us walk along near the foot of the ridge,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
answered Joe. “This is as good a spot to hunt
as it is higher up.”</p>

<p>The foot of the ridge led to something of a
hollow. Here was a long stretch of high brush,
the tops sticking out of the snow for several feet.</p>

<p>An hour’s tramp brought them to a still deeper
hollow where even the small trees were mostly
covered with snow. Here they had to walk with
extra care, for they knew the snow must be at least
ten feet deep, and neither had any desire to fall
once more and go floundering to the bottom under
the crust.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this,” said Joe presently. “It
worries me. Let us get to higher ground.” And
so they made their way back to the ridge and then
began, with extreme caution, to climb something
of a hill.</p>

<p>Noon found them in the shelter of a clump of
walnut trees. Their tramp had made them as
hungry as bears, and both willingly sat down to
rest on a fallen tree and to eat a portion of the
provisions their game bag contained.</p>

<p>“If we were depending on bear’s meat or venison
we’d go hungry,” was Joe’s comment, as he
munched a biscuit.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry, Joe. A half a day isn’t
three days, you know. Besides, we could have
had that partridge if we had wanted it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“I haven’t seen the first sign of a deer or a
bear yet.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I; but we are bound to strike
luck sooner or later,” answered Harry cheerfully.</p>

<p>Having rested themselves and eaten as much
of the provisions as they deemed advisable, they
went on their way once more. The timber now
became thicker, and at certain points the undergrowth
looked much greener than it had further
back.</p>

<p>“Just the spot for deer to come,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there are the signs,” answered
Harry, somewhat excitedly, and pointed to a
number of bushes that had been stripped of the
tenderest of their bark.</p>

<p>Back of the bushes the hoofprints of at least
three deer were plainly to be seen. How old the
trail was there was no means of telling, but for
the want of something better to do the two young
pioneers agreed to follow the marks, at least for
a mile should the traveling permit.</p>

<p>They now moved forward in utter silence, each
with his gun in his hand and eyes on the alert
in first one direction and then another. The
trail was by no means a straight one, and this
gave them encouragement.</p>

<p>“It shows that the deer took their time in moving
along,” said Joe. “You can see where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
stopped to nibble at every soft bush or tree that
showed itself.”</p>

<p>Just ahead was a heavy belt of timber not over
a hundred feet in width. Thinking that the game
might be on the other side they advanced with
greater caution than ever.</p>

<p>“I see one!” cried Harry softly.</p>

<p>“And I see another,” answered Joe.</p>

<p>They rushed forward and were almost on top
of the deer before they were discovered by the
animals. Then the deer tried to break away
through the snow, but soon came to a halt, panting
for breath.</p>

<p>“We could almost kill them with our hunting knives,”
said Harry, for he had heard of such
things being done. But the boys took no chances.
Each aimed for the eye and fired, and each shot
proved true, and the game was their own.</p>

<p>In the meantime the third deer of the party had
been lost to view in the thickets, and they did not
attempt to go after it. Now they had been so
successful they realized that they were “dog
tired,” as Joe expressed it.</p>

<p>“I move we build some sort of shelter and go
into camp for the night,” said he, and Harry
readily agreed.</p>

<p>In the timber belt they easily found several
trees growing in a rough semicircle. Here they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
cut boughs, and laced them together, and over all
packed the snow and slabs of ice. They also
chopped some wood for a fire and soon had a
comforting blaze in front of the shelter. By this
time it was dark, and both were hungry again,
and they proceeded to cook themselves some venison
steaks for the evening meal.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>NIGHT WITH THE WOLVES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">We</span> might spend a good while out in a camp
like this, provided we weren’t caught in too heavy
a snowstorm,” remarked Harry, while he and Joe
were disposing of the meal they had cooked for
themselves.</p>

<p>“Right you are, Harry. I believe we could
scare up lots of game, big and little.”</p>

<p>“How far do you imagine we are from home?”</p>

<p>“Not less than five miles. We did pretty well
on the snowshoes, all things considered.”</p>

<p>“Not counting the tumbles, you mean,” answered
Harry with a laugh.</p>

<p>The meal finished, they put away what was left
of the steaks for the morrow. They resolved to
keep a camp-fire burning all night, and for that
purpose chopped quite a pile of wood.</p>

<p>The shelter they had built was not over eight
feet in diameter, and on one side of this they
placed the carcasses of the deer, being afraid to
leave them outside, for fear that some wild animal
might come up and rob them of the prizes. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
lay down on the other side of the shelter, close
to the tiny doorway they had left. Just outside of
this doorway was the fire, which they heaped up
with chunks of wood piled as high as the limbs
overhead permitted.</p>

<p>“We must be careful of the flames,” cautioned
Joe. “We don’t want to set the forest on fire.”</p>

<p>Utterly worn out from the tramp on snowshoes,
they were both willing to retire early, and
an hour after sunset found them both at rest, almost
in each other’s arms. They had but scant
covering from the cold, but with the shelter and
the fire this was hardly necessary.</p>

<p>Harry was the first to fall asleep, and a little
later Joe, with a last glance at the fire, followed
suit.</p>

<p>An hour went by, followed by another. Outside,
scarcely a sound broke the stillness of the
night. The fire blazed away merrily as stick after
stick was consumed, and then gradually sank
lower and lower until only a flicker illuminated
the surroundings.</p>

<p>Then, from a distance, a lone wolf appeared,
on the trail of the deer that had been shot. The
wolf sniffed the air, and uttered a lonely howl that
was taken up by other wolves still further away.
In a very few minutes ten or a dozen of the animals
were gathered on the trail, and the pack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
moved slowly and cautiously toward where the
deer had been taken.</p>

<p>When the wolves came in sight of the fire they
paused again, and more lonely howls rent the
night air. But the scent of the deer was now
strong, and the wolves were desperately hungry,
and gradually they grew bolder and formed a
circle around the shelter.</p>

<p>Not far from the fire lay some of the bones of
the deer, and a bit of the meat that Harry had
burned in cooking the steaks. One wolf sneaked
in and gobbled up this, and on the instant a wild
howl of jealousy arose from the rest of the pack,
as they sprang in to get their share.</p>

<p>It was this howl which awoke Joe and Harry
with a start. Both sat up and rubbed their eyes,
for some of the smoke of the fire had drifted into
the shelter, and they could see but little in the
semi-darkness.</p>

<p>“Wolves!” The exclamation came from Joe,
and scarcely had he spoken when another howl
went up.</p>

<p>“There must be a whole pack of them,” cried
Harry. “And if that is so we are bound to have
a lively time of it.”</p>

<p>Each young pioneer had placed his gun where
he could put his hands upon it, and each caught
up his weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>The wolves now came closer, and, in their fight
among themselves, three of the pack tumbled up
against the shelter and broke through the snow
piled there.</p>

<p>“Hi! here they come!” ejaculated Joe, and,
taking aim at the nearest wolf, he let drive with
his rifle.</p>

<p>His aim was true, and the wolf fell back
dead.</p>

<p>The report of the rifle caused the wolves to
howl louder than ever, and some of them retreated
to a position beyond the flicker of the camp-fire.
But they now had the scent of blood in their
nostrils, and the boys saw that another attack was
coming.</p>

<p>“Get a brand from the fire!” shouted Harry,
and shot at the nearest of the beasts, sending a
second wolf to the ground.</p>

<p>The wolves were now snapping and snarling
on all sides, and before Joe could turn to the fire
one leaped for him, and fastened his teeth in the
heavy coat the youth wore.</p>

<p>Seeing this attack Harry leaped in to the rescue.
He had his gun by the barrel, and around came
the stock with a sweeping blow that crushed in
the beast’s skull.</p>

<p>Joe was near to the fire now, and caught up a
blazing brand and waved it in the air. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
kicked the other brands together, and threw on
some dry brushwood which was handy.</p>

<p>“They are going to carry off the deer!”
shouted Harry, and he was right. Two wolves
that had not taken part in the attack on the lads
were trying their best to haul away one of the
carcasses.</p>

<p>Catching up another firebrand, Joe hurled it at
the wolves, and it landed between them, directly
on the deer meat. At once the wolves dropped
their hold, and slunk back into the circling pack.</p>

<p>The young pioneers were now both at the fire,
and did what they could to make it blaze up. As
the light grew brighter the wolves slunk still further
back, and the fighting, for the time being,
came to an end.</p>

<p>“That was a struggle, wasn’t it?” panted
Harry, piling more wood on the flames. “At
the start I thought we’d be eaten up alive. Did
he bite you much?”</p>

<p>“No; his teeth only got into my coat,” answered
Joe.</p>

<p>“Do you think they’ll come back?”</p>

<p>“They will if we give them the chance.”</p>

<p>“Let us throw out the dead wolves. That will
give them something to feed on.”</p>

<p>The carcasses of the wolves were dragged from
the shelter, and while Joe carried two bright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
torches Harry dragged the dead wolves toward a
nearby hollow.</p>

<p>Hardly had the first carcass gone down than
the live wolves were on it, rending and tearing
it apart in a mad fury to get the meat.</p>

<p>“I’m glad it’s that meat instead of ourselves,”
was Harry’s comment, and he gave a shudder.</p>

<p>The dead wolves disposed of, they returned to
the camp-fire, and while Joe piled on what was
left of the wood Harry cut more, so that the blaze
might not die down even for a moment.</p>

<p>“Wild beasts hate fire worse than anything
else,” said Joe. “A good blaze will prove our
greatest protection.”</p>

<p>For over an hour they saw nothing more of the
wolves, for each of the pack had gotten his portion
of the dead ones, and was disposing of it greedily.</p>

<p>But now came a howl from a distance, and this
drew closer slowly. The scent of blood was in the
air, and another pack had found it and was tracing
it to its source.</p>

<p>“More wolves are coming!” ejaculated Joe,
and now his face turned pale. “Oh, Harry, do
you think there will be too many for us?”</p>

<p>“Let us make a half-circle of the fire and get
in it,” was the reply. “I think we can keep them
off if we try.”</p>

<p>A little later came a fierce howling from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
hollow. The second pack had come up and was
fighting for what was left of the wolves’ meat.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad there isn’t enough of that wolves’
meat to go around,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“Let us sneak up and knock over a couple more
of the beasts,” answered his chum.</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and, leaving the fire blazing
brightly, they sneaked through the snow to a
spot where they could catch sight of the howling
and struggling beasts.</p>

<p>Two clever shots caused two more of the wolves
to go down. They were the largest and heaviest
of the packs, and in a twinkling their fellows
leaped upon them, rending them limb from limb.</p>

<p>“What horrible creatures!” said Harry.
“They haven’t the slightest feeling for one another!”</p>

<p>“They have been half starved by the heavy fall
of snow, Harry. They wouldn’t be that way if
they could get anything else.”</p>

<p>Returning to the fire, they reloaded and chopped
more wood. In the hollow the wolves continued
to snarl and yelp, each trying to get the best of
the meat. Occasionally there would be a fierce
fight between two wolves lasting for several
minutes.</p>

<p>The fire had now dried out the branches hanging
over the shelter, and the boys had their hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
full keeping the blaze from mounting among the
trees. Twice it did catch, but they put out the
flames before they gained much headway.</p>

<p>It was not until early morning that the sounds
in the hollow ceased. Both of the boys could
scarcely keep their eyes open, yet each had refused
to go to sleep again.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take another look at those
wolves,” said Joe, and walked forward, gun in
one hand and firebrand in the other. He moved
with caution, but this was unnecessary. Every
wolf had vanished.</p>

<p>“They are gone!” he cried joyfully.</p>

<p>“Gone?” queried Harry. “Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Harry, they are gone, and have left
nothing but the bones and bits of hide behind
them.”</p>

<p>Both young pioneers inspected the hollow with
interest. The snow was churned up in all directions,
and hither and thither lay the bones, skulls,
and bits of hide and hair. By the tracks they
could see that what remained of the packs had
gone off to the southward.</p>

<p>“That was a night I don’t wish to duplicate,”
said Joe. “It’s enough to make one’s hair stand
on end to think about.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’ll come back again to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“That is true. We must be prepared for
them.”</p>

<p>Having had such an experience, the two young
hunters resolved to go no further from home, but
remain in that vicinity for the rest of their hunting
tour. This being so, they spent several hours in
strengthening the shelter, so that it might resist
another attack should it come.</p>

<p>Breakfast disposed of, they brought out a
couple of ropes they had carried along, and
hoisted the deer up into the branches of one of
the trees, so that the wolves would not be able to
get at them. Then they left a low, smudge fire
burning, and set off once more in quest of game.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>THE HUNTERS HUNTED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the rising of the sun the young pioneers
felt once more like themselves. The dangers of
the night were past, and they imagined that but
little could come to disturb them until darkness
had once again set in.</p>

<p>“It has got to be a bear to-day,” said Harry.
“If it isn’t I shall be much disappointed.”</p>

<p>“Reckon we’ll have to take what comes,” answered
Joe. Still he wanted to bring down a
bear as much as did his chum.</p>

<p>They resolved to strike out to the westward,
over the ridge and toward a hill topped with a
heavy growth of timber. Here was a series of
rough rocks which, according to Harry’s idea,
would make an ideal hiding place for a bear.</p>

<p>They set out on their snowshoes, and it was
not long before the ridge was gained, and then
they started directly for the hill, at a point where
there was something of a gorge or gully, where
in the summer time flowed a deep brook. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
this watercourse was now frozen over, and the
surface was covered with snow ten feet in depth.</p>

<p>A light breeze was blowing, otherwise the
weather was as it had been the day before. The
way up the hill was rather hard, and having
reached the top they were glad enough to sit
down on a fallen tree and rest.</p>

<p>Thus quarter of an hour went by, and they were
on the point of resuming their journey when Joe
caught sight of something moving through the
timber on the other side of the hill.</p>

<p>“Harry, what do you make out that to be?”
he whispered.</p>

<p>His chum took a careful look.</p>

<p>“I believe it’s a bear!”</p>

<p>“That is just what I was thinking.”</p>

<p>“If it’s a bear, how are we to get up to him?”</p>

<p>“We had better skulk along behind the trees.
I can go to the right, and you can go to the left.
But don’t fire until you are sure of what you are
aiming at.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>With their guns before them the two young
hunters left the vicinity of the fallen log, and
proceeded in the direction of the object. They
soon separated a distance of a hundred feet.</p>

<p>It was not long before Joe made out the object
to be a black bear beyond any doubt. The big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
fellow was lumbering along clumsily as if either
tired or wounded. As a matter of fact he had
been in a fight with some other wild animals the
day before, and had received severe nips in the
shoulder and the left foreleg.</p>

<p>It was not long before the bear saw that he was
being pursued, and then he started off on something
of a gallop through the snow, sending the
latter flying in all directions.</p>

<p>“Fire on him!” shouted Joe, and let drive, followed
immediately by his companion.</p>

<p>Both shots took effect, but neither was serious,
and they only caused the bear to utter a savage
roar of pain and rage. He turned as if to attack
Harry.</p>

<p>“Look out, he is coming for you!” yelled Joe,
who was reloading with all possible speed.</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the bear turned
and, seeing Joe, paused. Then he changed his
course.</p>

<p>“He is coming for you!” screamed Harry.
“Get out of the way, unless you want to be
hugged to death!”</p>

<p>Joe had scarcely time enough to throw some
powder and a bullet into his rifle, and fix the priming,
when the huge black beast made a leap for
him. Crack! went the firearm, and the bear was
struck on the side of the neck. With a snort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
pain he stopped once more, then turned and hurried
away as before.</p>

<p>By the time Harry was ready to fire again the
bear was out of reach of his gun, behind a growth
of trees and brushwood. He was keeping to a
stretch of ground swept clear of snow by the wind.
When the boys reached the timber he had disappeared
in the vicinity of a pile of rocks.</p>

<p>“More than likely his den is in there,” said
Joe. “We want to go slow now, or we’ll fall
into a trap.”</p>

<p>The tracks of the bear were plainly to be seen.
They led over the very roughest of the rocks,
where it was utterly impossible to follow with
snowshoes.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to take the shoes off and strap
them to our backs,” said Joe, and this they did,
keeping an eye open for the black bear in the
meantime.</p>

<p>The rocks were covered with slippery ice, and
both had not progressed far before they began to
slide in one direction or another.</p>

<p>“Take care,” said Harry. “Give me your
hand,” and they moved forward holding tightly
to each other.</p>

<p>All might have gone well had not the bear suddenly
appeared when least expected. This caused
the young pioneers to start back, and both lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
their balance and slipped from the rocks to an
opening far below.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” cried Harry, and then plunged
into a snowbank, with Joe after him.</p>

<p>When the boys recovered from the shock, they
found themselves under the side of a large sloping
rock. In front of them was the snowbank that
had probably saved each from a broken neck. Behind
them was a rough opening, leading partly
between and partly under the rock.</p>

<p>“Are yo—you all—all right?” panted Joe,
when he could catch his breath.</p>

<p>“I—I reck—reckon so,” was the answer. “I—I
aint sure yet,” and Harry shook himself to
find out if any bones were broken.</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if the bear was hunting us
instead of us hunting the bear,” went on Joe
grimly.</p>

<p>“Do you see anything of him now?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Harry had lost his gun in the snow, and it took
a minute to find this and put on a fresh priming.
Then both kept a sharp lookout for the bear, but
the animal did not appear.</p>

<p>“What shall we do next?” asked Joe, rather
blankly.</p>

<p>“Well, one thing is certain, Joe, we can’t stay
down here all day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“Do you think the bear is up there above us?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised.”</p>

<p>After another wait Joe proceeded to explore
the opening behind them. He found it of no
great depth, with a passageway leading upward
between two of the larger rocks.</p>

<p>Just as he made this discovery he made another,
more important. The black bear was squeezing
his way downward through the passageway!</p>

<p>“He is coming down after us, Harry!”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Back here! Come, let us both give him another
shot!”</p>

<p>Joe already had his gun leveled, and he blazed
away the moment his chum was beside him.
Harry followed suit, filling the small opening with
dense smoke.</p>

<p>A roar followed the shots, ringing loudly in
their ears in that confined space. As they could
no longer see the bear they took no chances, but
leaped back into the snowbank, and then began to
scramble up the rocks as fast as they could. Joe
reached the top first, and gave a willing hand to
his companion.</p>

<p>The first work of the young pioneers was to
reload once more. In the meanwhile they heard
several roars and grunts from the bear, the sound
reaching them as from under the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“If he backs out, we can give him two more
shots in his hind quarters,” said Harry. “Those
ought to finish him unless he is as tough as sole
leather.”</p>

<p>They waited for the appearance of the bear,
but the animal did not show himself. Something
like a prolonged grunt came up to them, and after
that all was quiet.</p>

<p>“Do you think we really killed him after all?”
came from Harry, as he attempted to look into the
opening from the top.</p>

<p>“It’s possible. But let us wait a while, and see
if he makes another move.”</p>

<p>Five—ten—fifteen minutes passed, and at last
they came to the conclusion that the game must
be either dead or mortally wounded.</p>

<p>“I’m going to poke into the hole and see,” said
Joe. “I’ll do it with the muzzle of the gun, so if
he has turned around he’ll get the ball directly
down his throat.”</p>

<p>With caution he approached the opening, and
poked down into it with his firearm. At first he
could feel nothing. Then he grew more daring,
and crawled down several feet.</p>

<p>“Here he is,” he cried, a moment later. “He
seems to be stuck fast between the rocks, and I
reckon he is stone-dead.”</p>

<p>Growing bolder, both went as far into the opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
as possible. They found the bear wedged in
tightly, and he uttered no sound when shoved
sharply with the gun barrels, or when stabbed
with Harry’s hunting knife.</p>

<p>“He’s dead, sure enough,” said Harry. “But
we might as well crawl down the rocks again, and
take a look at him from the front.”</p>

<p>Instead of crawling down, each took a leap into
the snowbank. They felt strangely elated over
bringing the bear low, and now approached him
boldly, yet with their guns once more ready for
use.</p>

<p>But there was no need for further fear. The
game was dead beyond all doubt, and had probably
died when they heard the last groan from
him.</p>

<p>“He is ours!” cried Harry. “And what a
big fellow he is, too.”</p>

<p>“It’s a great haul, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I reckon the haul is still to come, Joe. We’ll
have to yank him out of that hole somehow.”</p>

<p>“Or bring up a horse to do it,” was the gay
answer. Both of the boys felt like whistling and
singing over their luck. And small wonder, for
to bring down such game was not an everyday
occurrence.</p>

<p>After inspecting the situation, both came to the
conclusion that the easiest way of getting the bear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
out of the hole would be to haul him forward to
the front of the rocks, and then slide him along
the snow and over a patch of ice to where there
was something of an incline leading to the top of
the hill.</p>

<p>It was hard work, and it took all of an hour
to get the bear half the distance. Both boys were
perspiring freely, and very soon had to stop for
breath.</p>

<p>“We are earning this bear,” said Joe, while
wiping his forehead. “I never worked so hard
before in my whole life.”</p>

<p>“That’s the fun of hunting,” answered Harry.
“Of course, you wish the bear was only half as
large.”</p>

<p>“Do I? Not much! I want him just as big
as he is. Won’t they be surprised at home and at
the fort when they hear of this?”</p>

<p>“It’s the biggest bear brought down, so far as
I know.”</p>

<p>“After this I think we may as well start right
for home.”</p>

<p>“I am willing.”</p>

<p>At the top of the hill they found a long and
sweeping pine branch, and of this made the best
drag they could, and then fastened the bear on top
with withes.</p>

<p>“Now for a long and hard pull,” said Joe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
“We must get him home to-night. If we don’t
the wolves may steal him from us.”</p>

<p>“What about the deer?”</p>

<p>“We can come back for them to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But if some wildcats come at them in the
meanwhile?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to stand the risk of that.”</p>

<p>And then, after a lunch in the open, they started
for home, dragging their splendid prize after
them.</p>

<small>DANIEL BOONE’S GREAT SHOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, Harmony, the boys are coming back!”</p>

<p>“So I see, Cora. What is that they are dragging
on the snow behind them?”</p>

<p>“Some game, I suppose. Mrs. Parsons, can
you make it out?”</p>

<p>The Quakeress gave a long look.</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if ’twere a bear,” she answered
slowly. “But we shall soon know for
certain, girls, so be patient.”</p>

<p>Throwing on their capes and hoods, Cora and
Harmony rushed out of the log cabin, and to the
end of the path that had been shoveled through
the snow.</p>

<p>“It is a bear!” cried Harmony.</p>

<p>“And a big one, too!” put in her sister.</p>

<p>When the young pioneers reached the girls they
were all but exhausted over the long, hard pull.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe, what a splendid success!” ejaculated
Harmony. “Who brought him down?”</p>

<p>“Both of us,” answered the brother. “And we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
had a hard time of it, too, I can tell you. We
hunted the bear and then he hunted us, and we
might not have had him at all only he got stuck
fast between the rocks.”</p>

<p>The youths decided to bring the bear directly up
to the cabin door. Here Mrs. Parsons came out
with a torch, for it was now dark.</p>

<p>“Thee has done well, my son,” said she. “And
thee, too, Joseph. ’Twill give us meat for many
a long day to come.”</p>

<p>“And what a splendid robe the bear-skin will
make,” came from Harmony.</p>

<p>The boys were too tired to skin and cut up the
bear that night, so the game was hauled into the
cabin, and placed in the coldest corner the building
boasted. Then all the others bustled about to get
the young hunters a substantial supper.</p>

<p>And how good that meal tasted! It was well
enough to camp in the open, but nothing at all
compared to what Mrs. Parsons and the girls
were able to set before them. They ate and ate,
and in the meantime told of their several adventures.</p>

<p>It was well for the lads that they were under a
roof that night, for with the setting of the sun
the temperature began to drop steadily until the
night became one of the coldest Kentucky had
ever experienced. The wind arose and hummed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
and shrieked through the trees of the forest so
that sound sleeping was almost out of the question.</p>

<p>“Had we remained in the woods we would
have been frozen to death,” said Joe, and Harry
agreed with him.</p>

<p>Fortunately the bitter cold spell did not last
over forty-eight hours, and on the third day the
sun came out as bright and warm as ever.</p>

<p>“We must get out to-day for those deer,” said
Joe. “If we don’t go soon some wild animals
will get at them sure.”</p>

<p>The high winds had swept the rocks free of all
loose snow, so traveling was not as difficult as it
had been. They went again on snowshoes, and
took their firearms as before.</p>

<p>“As we are not after any big game we can now
shoot anything that strikes our fancy,” said Joe,
and on the way bagged several rabbits and a wild
turkey, while Harry knocked over several ruffled
grouse, or pheasants.</p>

<p>“Not a bad haul in itself,” said Joe, when their
game bags were fairly stuffed with their quarry.
“Counting these, and the deer, and the bear, I
reckon we have done as well as many older
hunters could do.”</p>

<p>On and on they went until, about noon, they
came to the patch of forest in which they had
formerly camped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“Here are some fresh tracks!” cried Harry,
presently. “Some hunter has been around here,
either this morning or yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anybody,” answered his companion,
after a long look around.</p>

<p>“Nor do I.”</p>

<p>“Hope our deer are safe,” went on Joe, suddenly,
remembering the trouble they had had with
Yellow Blanket.</p>

<p>They pushed on and soon reached the site of the
former camp. The two deer hung as they had
left them, and the boys drew a long sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>“We got scared over nothing,” was Harry’s
comment.</p>

<p>“But those tracks were there!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, plain enough.”</p>

<p>“Then the hunter must have turned in some
other direction.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I couldn’t see the trail after passing
over yonder rocks.”</p>

<p>The tree branches were thick in this vicinity, so
that the boys could see but little of what was above
them. They set to work without delay, and soon
one deer was lowered to the ground and then
the other. Then two drags were cut down and
the game was tied fast with ropes.</p>

<p>“Now for dinner and then for home,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Joe. “By the time we get back I reckon we’ll be
as tired as we was when we hauled in the bear.”</p>

<p>The young pioneers had brought along some
cooked food, so they did not bother with starting
up a fire. The tramp had kept them warm,
and they sat down on some rocks to eat their
midday meal.</p>

<p>While they were eating they did not notice a
dark form circling about them and drawing
closer and closer with every step. Yet such was
the fact, and the form was that of a brownish-black
wolverene.</p>

<p>It may be remarked here that the wolverene,
often known by the name of glutton, is one of
the wildest and fiercest beasts ever met with in
any North American forest. It is similar to a
small bear in appearance, but has a larger mouth
and teeth and larger and sharper claws. It is
a great lover of raw meat, and will fight sometimes
to the bitter end to obtain what it desires.
It has an especial fondness for the meat of the
deer and the beaver.</p>

<p>This wolverene had scented the two deer in
the tree the day before and all night long and
during the morning it had tried to get at the
meat, but could not, on account of the swinging
ropes. Now it saw the game lying on the drags,
and the young hunters several yards away, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
was meditating a leap forward in an effort to
secure at least part of the longed-for prey.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the beast, its eyes
gleaming wickedly and its cruel jaws working
convulsively. It crawled on the ground with the
stealthiness of a panther.</p>

<p>When it was less than twenty feet away,
Harry suddenly arose and walked toward the
game, to examine the deer heads, to see if they
would be worth preserving.</p>

<p>The wolverene saw the movement and its hopes
of getting at the coveted prey sank. Then it
grew furious at the advance of the young hunter
and crouched still lower, with the intention of
leaping straight for Harry’s throat.</p>

<p>All unconscious of his danger, Harry turned
around, and then for the first time saw what he
was facing. At the same instant the tail of the
wolverene gave a swish, and the beast rose high
into the air as it leaped for Harry’s throat.</p>

<p>But the wolverene never landed as expected.
While it was yet in mid-air, the report of a rifle
echoed through the forest and the beast fell to
the ground with a strange snapping and snarling,
and then of a sudden stretched itself out in death.</p>

<p>“Oh!” It was all Harry could say for the
time being. He gazed at the wolverene in a
dazed sort of way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“Harry!” burst out Joe, and ran forward,
rifle in hand. “A wolverene, and dead, too!
How did you do it?”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t do it, Joe.”</p>

<p>“But he is shot—right through the left eye,”
went on Joe.</p>

<p>“So I see. But I haven’t any gun with me.
Mine is over on the rock.”</p>

<p>“Fetched him, didn’t I?” came in a clear voice,
from the trees behind the young hunters, and
turning swiftly they found themselves confronted
by Daniel Boone, whose long rifle was still smoking
from the shot.</p>

<p>“So you shot him, Colonel Boone?” said
Harry.</p>

<p>“I did, lad. It was a hard shot too, I admit—firing
right over your shoulder at him. If the
rifle had swung around you might have got the
ball in the neck.”</p>

<p>“You—you saved my life, colonel.”</p>

<p>“We won’t speak of that, lad. I’m glad I
came up in time. I was out hunting myself, just
for the fun of it, and I saw you coming this way
and thought I’d find out if you had had any luck.
That wolverene must have been all-fired hungry,
to come at you in that fashion. But the deer meat
worried him, I suppose.”</p>

<p>It was some time before Harry could get over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
his scare, and the party of three sat down on the
rocks to compare notes. Daniel Boone had
brought down three deer since early morning, and
had placed them where he could send out other
hunters to bring them in later on.</p>

<p>“There are only a few wolverenes left around
here,” he said. “I doubt if you are troubled by
any more of them, but after this you had better
be on guard all the time.”</p>

<p>“I will be,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>“Is the meat good for anything?” questioned
Joe.</p>

<p>“Some of the old-time hunters eat it,” answered
Daniel Boone. “I never did. Better
leave it for the wolves,” and this they did, after
cutting off the long, white claws, which Boone
told them were valuable, the Indians thinking
more of such things than of money in making a
trade.</p>

<p>The two young hunters were glad enough to
have Daniel Boone accompany them home, and
the great hunter willingly helped them along with
their drags. He was much interested in the
story about the big bear.</p>

<p>“You are both doing well,” he said. “In
fact, I doubt if any old hunters in these parts
have done better.”</p>

</figure>

<p>They asked him if he had heard anything more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
of the expedition that had moved westward in
search of the Indian captives.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” replied Daniel Boone. “And
I don’t expect to hear anything until spring.
Nobody is going to travel very far in such weather
as this, in a country where there isn’t anything
better than an Indian or a buffalo trail.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care how long we have to wait, if
only when the news comes it is good news,” said
Joe soberly.</p>

<p>“I suppose you miss your mother a good bit,
lad. Well, I can’t say as I blame you. A good
mother is the best blessing a boy ever had.”</p>

<p>“And I miss my sister,” came from Harry.</p>

<p>“That is the one bad feature of moving into
the Indian country, boys. It is bad enough to
be wounded in a fight, but it is far worse to have
those we love carried off to we don’t know where,
and treated we don’t know how.”</p>

<p>“Has Red Feather said anything more?”
asked Joe.</p>

<p>“No. He is waiting patiently for his release.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you suppose he will go on the warpath
as soon as you let him go?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But if he does I shall hunt him
down and have no mercy on him.”</p>

<p>“I wish all the fighting would come to an end,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
said Harry, with a sigh. “I think I’d just like
to have a few years at quiet farming and nothing
else.”</p>

<p>“It would be nice, but I am afraid we are a
long way from that yet,” answered Daniel Boone.
And he was right, as later events on the bloodstained
soil of Kentucky proved.</p>

<small>THE FOOT RACE AT THE FORT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> remainder of the winter passed without
special incident. The cold weather seemed to
come “all in a bunch,” as Joe put it, and after
that it was quite mild, so that they could come
and go as they pleased.</p>

<p>During those days of waiting the young
pioneers were not idle. There were many
things to do in and around the frontier home,
and when not employed there the two youths went
gunning or fishing, or else set traps. It was
Daniel Boone himself who showed them how to
make several traps of a superior sort, and with
them the game captured was by no means to be
despised.</p>

<p>“He is a natural-born hunter and trapper,”
said Harry, in speaking of Boone. “He takes
to it like an Indian to a buffalo trail.”</p>

<p>Among the traps made by Joe was a large one,
strong enough to hold a catamount, and possibly
a bear. It was of the old-fashioned chain variety,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
with a powerful jaw, and set close to the ground.
Joe had seen the footprints of some wild animal
midway between the edge of the clearing and
a small pond that, in summer, connected with
the watercourse near the cabin, and here he set
up the trap one day when Harry was busy around
the house.</p>

<p>On the following day Harry started to go fishing
through a hole in the ice on the pond. Joe
had work to do at home, so did not accompany
him.</p>

<p>“Do not stay away after dark, Harry,” cautioned
his mother. “I think it will snow before
morning.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be back by supper-time,” answered the
son.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to reach the pond.
He had brought his ax with him, and soon had
a hole in the ice a foot or more in diameter. Then
he brought forth some bait, and also a spear, and
did his best to catch some of the fish he knew
must be in the pond.</p>

<p>But the specimens of the finny tribe were not
biting, and, although he fished for two hours
steadily, he got nothing. Then, in disgust, he
wound up his line.</p>

<p>As usual he had his gun with him, and now
he determined to look for a little game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“I’m not going home empty-handed,” he told
himself. “If I do Joe will have the laugh on
me.”</p>

<p>It was growing colder, and the standing still
over the hole in the ice had chilled Harry not a
little. To get his blood into circulation he started
to run, and did not stop until he stumbled over
a tree root and pitched headlong.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a tumble!” he muttered, when he
could get back his wind. He arose slowly, and
after that walked with care.</p>

<p>But luck was against poor Harry that day,
and only two rabbits appeared in sight. One disappeared
before he could take aim, and the other
he missed entirely.</p>

<p>“Just so much powder and shot wasted,” he
thought. “Reckon I had better go home.”</p>

<p>The winter day was drawing to a close, and
there was a dampness in the air that made him
shiver. Several times he had to slap his hands
together to get them warm, but after that he
grew colder and colder.</p>

<p>“Wish I was back home in front of the fire,”
he said to himself. “There is no fun in hunting
or fishing alone, anyhow.”</p>

<p>In the semi-darkness he stumbled along in the
direction of the cabin. A light fall of snow had
started, and this kept growing heavier and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
heavier. The snow made it darker than ever, and
he could see his way only with difficulty.</p>

<p>Harry reached the pond to find the surface
covered with the flying flakes. Instead of going
around he started to cross the ice.</p>

<p>When in the very middle of the pond, the next
misfortune of the outing came upon him. Down
went one foot into the hole he had cut a short
while before, and ere he could save himself he
received a wetting up to the knee.</p>

<p>“What an all-around fool I am making of
myself!” he cried, half aloud. “To cut the hole in
the first place, and then step into it afterward!
How Joe will laugh at me if I tell him. But I
just won’t open my mouth about it.”</p>

<p>The wet leg and foot grew colder rapidly, until
Harry was afraid both would freeze. He
stamped on the foot many times, and then started
onward again.</p>

<p>But his chapter of misfortunes had not yet
reached its climax. That came when he stepped
into the trap Joe had set. There was a click, and
of a sudden Harry felt something press his dry
ankle as if the member was in a vise.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” he yelled. “Let go! Oh!”</p>

<p>But the trap did not let go, and, dropping his
gun, the young pioneer clutched at the grip and
the chain, and tried to force the former open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>But Joe had calculated that that grip should
“stay put” if once it caught hold of anything,
and the more Harry tried to release himself the
tighter the trap seemed to fasten on his ankle,
until the pressure became positively painful.</p>

<p>“What in the world am I to do now?”
thought the youth, and gazed at the trap in
dismay.</p>

<p>The trap was a “long” one—that is, the end
of the release chain was out of Harry’s reach,
so that unfastening himself by such means was
out of the question.</p>

<p>“I’m as much of a prisoner as if I was a wild
animal,” thought the young pioneer. “I’ll have
to remain here until Joe or somebody else comes
along to set me free.”</p>

<p>The snow now covered the ground to the
depth of over an inch, and came down more
thickly than ever. Poor Harry’s feet were almost
frozen, one on account of the wet, and the other
because of being clutched in the trap. He
stamped the wet foot vigorously, but even this
helped him little.</p>

<p>“If I have to stay here all night, I’ll die,” he
thought, and his heart sank within him.</p>

<p>Half an hour went by. He tugged, twisted,
and pried on the trap, but all to no purpose. Then
he imagined he heard the howl of a wolf in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
distance, and he saw a lean fox come out into
a clearing, and gaze wonderingly at him.</p>

<p>“They’ll make short work of me if they learn
I am helpless,” he thought dismally. “Oh, I
must get away somehow!”</p>

<p>When the fox came closer Harry raised his
gun and fired on the creature, killing it. This
gave the youth a new idea.</p>

<p>“I’ll fire off a number of light charges,” he
said to himself. “Perhaps Joe will hear them,
and come here to learn what they mean.”</p>

<p>He had powder enough in his horn for ten
half-charges, and he began to discharge his firearm
at intervals of three or four minutes each.
Then he listened eagerly for some answering
sound that would tell him his signals had been
heard.</p>

<p>But no answering shot came back, and once
again his heart sank, this time lower than ever.</p>

<p>“If Joe heard those shots he would surely fire
in return,” he told himself.</p>

<p>Another hour went by, and now it was very
dark around him. Harry felt so cold he could
stand no longer. He sank down in the snow, his
teeth chattering. Then a drowsy feeling crept
over him, and he found himself strongly inclined
to sleep.</p>

<p>The youth knew he must fight off the feeling—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
if he gave way it would probably prove his
last sleep on earth.</p>

<p>“They’ll find me frozen stiff, if they ever do
get here before the wild animals,” he said to himself.
And to keep himself awake he began to sing
at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>“Harry Harry! Have you gone crazy?”</p>

<p>The cry came from the thicket close at hand,
and on the instant Joe burst into view. Harry
did not see him at once, and kept on with his
snatch of a song.</p>

<p>“Harry, don’t you hear me? What on earth
is the matter? Have you lost your senses?”</p>

<p>“Joe!” The song came to an abrupt conclusion.
“Oh, how thankful I am you have come.
Release me from this trap of yours, and get me
home, before I freeze to death.”</p>

<p>“Are you in the trap? By George, you are!
Of course I’ll release you!”</p>

<p>Dropping his gun, Joe leaped to the end of the
chain, and in a second more the trap was opened,
and Harry withdrew his foot slowly and painfully.
Then he tried to walk a step, but his feelings
overcame him, and he fell in the snow in a
death-like faint.</p>

<p>Joe was now more alarmed than ever, and
picking his companion up he placed Harry over
his shoulder, and set out for home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>It was a hard walk that Joe never forgot. The
snow came down so thickly that he was nearly
blinded. He staggered up to the cabin clearing,
and caught Mrs. Parsons just as the good woman
was peering anxiously from the doorway.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him, and he is half frozen,” said Joe,
and staggered into the cabin.</p>

<p>“Mercy on us!” cried Harmony. “See, his
foot is bleeding!”</p>

<p>“He got into my trap by accident,” said Joe.</p>

<p>All set to work to restore the sufferer, but it
was several hours before Harry was once more
himself. Then he told the tale of his various
misfortunes.</p>

<p>“I want no more fishing through the ice, or
nothing more of your traps,” he said.</p>

<p>“Better break the trap up,” said Mrs. Parsons,
and to please her Joe took the trap to a more
remote part of the wood, and placed over it a
sign of warning. Later on he caught in it two
wolves, but that was all.</p>

<p>During the winter nothing was heard of the
party who had gone after the Indians, and only
once did the people of Boonesborough hear from
the red men themselves, and that was when a party
of four came to the fort more dead than alive and
asked for shelter and something to eat. They
were given something to eat and allowed to sleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
in front of one of the fires, and went off the next
day apparently grateful for this kindness.</p>

<p>It was not until the middle of March that word
came in from the expedition that had gone to
hunt for the missing whites. One of the men
rode into the settlement at about noon. He was
wounded in the shoulder and rode a horse that
was utterly fagged out.</p>

<p>“We had two engagements with the redskins,”
said this man. “One about ten days ago and
one three days ago. We drove them from their
village on the bank of a small river into a belt of
timber eight or ten miles away. We killed not
less than twelve of the band.”</p>

<p>“How many of our side were killed or
wounded?” questioned Colonel Boone.</p>

<p>“That I can’t say exactly. I saw Hassock
killed and Peter Parsons got an arrow through
his left arm. That was at the first fight. At
the second I was knocked over almost the first
thing and fell into a gully. When I got around
again the fighting was off in another direction.
I tried to find the rest of the party, but could not,
so I came home.”</p>

<p>Harry was anxious to learn if his father had
been seriously hurt, but the messenger could give
no particulars. He said that the Indians had
been living in two villages about half a mile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
apart, and that there were prisoners at each village,
although nobody had been able to find out
exactly who the captives were.</p>

<p>These tidings only served to cast an additional
gloom upon those living at the home of the Parsons
and Winships.</p>

<p>“’Tis hard to think that thy father has been
sorely wounded,” said Mrs. Parsons to Harry.
“Perhaps it had been better had he remained at
home.”</p>

<p>“Well, mother, all we can do is to hope for
the best,” was the son’s reply.</p>

<p>“When are the others coming back?” questioned
Harmony.</p>

<p>“The messenger could not say,” answered Joe.
“I reckon he was too weak to take much account
of what was going on, after he was knocked
over.”</p>

<p>With the first sign of spring the boys prepared
to go ahead with the work of clearing and tilling
the land. This was hard labor for those so young
in years, yet they went at the task manfully. They
worked from five o’clock in the morning until
sundown, with only a short rest for dinner.</p>

<p>One thing was in their favor—they remained
perfectly healthy. While others got chills and
fever and dumb ague, and other ailments incident
to turning up new ground and working in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
meadow-like places, Joe and Harry hardly knew
what a sick day was. Their appetites remained
good, and gradually their muscles became as hard
as iron.</p>

<p>They were not without their days of sport.
Saturday was generally more or less of an “off
day,” and if the youths did not go hunting, fishing,
or swimming, they would join the other lads
of the settlement in games or friendly contests—rowing,
running, jumping, wrestling, or shooting
at a target. The target-shooting made each
a good shot, much to their own satisfaction.</p>

<p>“It’s a great thing to know you can depend on
your eye if you are ever placed in a tight hole,”
said Joe. “A clever shot may sometime save
a fellow’s life.”</p>

<p>“As that shot of Colonel Boone’s saved mine,”
added Harry.</p>

<p>Harry prided himself somewhat on his running,
and when, one Saturday afternoon, a race
was arranged between the young men and boys
of the settlement he entered eagerly. The race
was presided over by an old settler named Leary,
who put up two prizes, a polished powder horn
and a brass bullet-mold, the first one in to take
his choice of the offerings.</p>

<p>Around Boonesborough there was no straight
road for such a race, so it was decided that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
contest was to be a go-as-you-please affair, extending
half a mile up the river trail and back.
The turning point was a large flat rock, at which
was stationed a man who checked off the runners
as they came up and made the turn.</p>

<p>Seven boys and young men took part in
the contest, the youngest being fifteen and the
oldest twenty-two. The boy of fifteen was tall
and slim, with a pair of legs that were almost as
nimble as those of a deer, and more than one
spectator picked this lad, whose name was Darry
Ford, as a winner. A young man of twenty
named Jackson, and another named Ferris, were
also favorites.</p>

<p>“Harry, you have got to run well to come in
ahead on this race,” said Joe as he and his chum
put off to the starting point. “Both Jackson and
Ferris have entered, and Darry Ford is to be in
it, too.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to run as well as I can,” answered
Harry.</p>

<p>“If I was you I’d take it a bit easy going down
to the rock. Remember, the way back is uphill.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll remember that, Joe. Do you know
the one I fear the most?”</p>

<p>“Jackson?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“Then Ferris?”</p>

<p>“Neither. It is Darry Ford. He has such
long legs, and his wind is splendid. He’ll get
back uphill without trouble,” said Harry.</p>

<p>When the pair arrived at the spot where the
contest was to take place they found a goodly
crowd assembled. The other contestants had just
come in, and each was surrounded by a little band
of admirers. Not a few bets were made on the
result.</p>

<p>“Do you think you have got any show against
Jack Ferris?” demanded one of the crowd of
Harry.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try my luck, Luke Stout.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get left.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Want to bet against Ferris?” went on Luke
Stout loudly.</p>

<p>“I don’t bet, Luke.”</p>

<p>“Afraid?”</p>

<p>“No, but I don’t bet.”</p>

<p>“Humph! That shows you are afraid,”
sneered the big youth, and shuffled off.</p>

<p>Joe could not stand this, and running forward
he touched Luke Stout on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“I will bet with you that Harry comes in ahead
of Jack Ferris,” he said calmly. “What will you
bet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“I was going to put up my pocket knife,” said
Stout, hauling it out. “She’s a good three-blader.”</p>

<p>“Mine is as good,” said Joe, and brought the
article forth. “Three blades, too, and a Boston
knife at that.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you up,” came eagerly from Luke
Stout. And the knives were deposited with another
party who said he would act as stakeholder.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe, why did you put up that knife,”
whispered Harry. “It’s the one your father gave
you on your last birthday.”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect to lose it, Harry. You must
win Stout’s knife for me.”</p>

<p>“But he may come in ahead.”</p>

<p>“You said you didn’t fear anybody but Darry
Ford. I wagered that you would come in ahead
of Jack Ferris, not that you would win the
race.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is something. But still—he may
come in ahead of me.”</p>

<p>It was now time to start, and the contestants
were called together by Andrew Leary, who explained
to them the conditions under which they
were to run.</p>

<p>“You are to start when I clap my hands,” he
said. “And you must pass around to the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
when you reach the rock on which Frank Fordham
is standing. The first one over this line on
the return is the winner, and the second takes
second prize. Now line up, all of you.”</p>

<p>The seven contestants lined up, Harry in the
center, with Darry Ford on his left, and Ferris
and Jackson on his right.</p>

<p>“Are you all ready?” asked Andrew Leary.
There was a moment of intense silence. “Go!”
he roared, and clapped his hands loudly.</p>

<p>Away went the seven at a bound, side by side,
and each running swiftly and gracefully. The
pace was a “hot” one from the beginning, for
just beyond the starting point the trail narrowed
down, so that not more than three or four could
run abreast, and all wanted to keep in the lead.</p>

<p>It was a runner named Brown who forged
ahead first, followed by another named Wilson.
Both were heavy-set fellows, and crowded Darry
Ford a good deal as they sped along.</p>

<p>“Go it, fellows, go it!” was the cry of the onlookers.</p>

<p>“Get to the front, Darry!” shouted one.</p>

<p>“Show ’em what you can do, Ferris!” yelled
Luke Stout.</p>

<p>“Save your wind, Harry,” came from Joe.
“Remember, the race is for a mile!”</p>

<p>On and on, and still on, sped the runners over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
the rough trail, leaping many a rough rock or
fallen log, in steeplechase fashion. The roughness
of the way now told on Brown, and gradually
he dropped behind, and Wilson followed. Then
it was seen that Jackson and Ferris were in the
lead, with Darry Ford third, and Harry fourth.</p>

<p>“Jackson will win!”</p>

<p>“Ferris is crawling up to him!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet on Darry Ford. Just you wait until
he begins spurting.”</p>

<p>It was now that a turn in the trail hid the runners
from view for a moment. When they came
again into the open it was seen that Ferris and
Jackson had changed places, and that the others
were as before.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you?” roared Luke Stout.
“I knew Jack Ferris would win. Winship, that
knife is as good as mine.”</p>

<p>“The race isn’t over yet, Stout.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! Ferris is first and Harry Parsons is
fourth. Do you think he is going to crawl into
the lead? Not much!”</p>

<p>A minute later came another cry, from those
further up the trail.</p>

<p>“They are rounding the rock!”</p>

<p>“Ferris is in the lead!”</p>

<p>“Darry Ford has jumped to second place!
Jackson is third.”</p>

There goes Wilson ahead of him!”</p>

<p>It was true, Harry had stumbled over a loose
stick. But he was up in a moment. Then he
rounded the rock, and, fifth in the race, started on
the home-stretch.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>WHO WAS THE WINNER?</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> must be acknowledged that the pace was now
beginning to tell upon all in the race. On even
ground it would not have been so trying, but it
took wind, and plenty of it, to clear some of the
rocks, gullies, and fallen logs that marked the
novel racecourse.</p>

<p>One racer was out of it entirely, having
sprained his foot by an unlucky slip on a rock,
and another dropped so far behind that he soon
after gave up entirely.</p>

<p>This left five, and of these Harry was the last
as the halfway rock was rounded and the racers
sped for the finishing line.</p>

<p>But Wilson, the man who had leaped to fourth
place, could not keep the pace set for him, and
soon he, too, dropped behind and out, thus making
Harry fourth, with Ferris first, Darry Ford
second, and Jackson third.</p>

<p>This position was maintained until the runners
were not over a quarter of a mile from the goal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
Then it was seen that Jackson could no longer
keep up with the others. He leaped a log,
slipped, and sat squarely on the ground.</p>

<p>“Go on, all of you!” he panted. “I’ve got
all I want of racing!”</p>

<p>Harry was now in third place, and running as
he had never run before. His “second wind” had
come to him, and he was within four yards of
Darry Ford, with Jack Ferris three yards further
in advance.</p>

<p>Ferris was running well, and those at a distance
felt that he would surely come in the winner.
But now Darry Ford gradually closed the
distance between them, and Harry began to crawl
up also, until the three were almost in a bunch.</p>

<p>“Here they come!”</p>

<p>“Jack Ferris still leads!” yelled Luke Stout.
“Told you he’d win out!”</p>

<p>“Darry Ford is a close second. See, he is pulling
up to Ferris by inches!”</p>

<p>“Harry is coming up, too,” came from Joe.
His face was flushed with excitement. “Run,
Harry, run!” he yelled. “You can make it yet!”</p>

<p>Harry heard the cry, and it nerved him to do
his utmost. He leaped on with steps almost
equaling those of long-legged Darry Ford, and
soon he was on the very heels of the leaders, who
were now rushing on side by side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“It will be a tie!” cried the crowd.</p>

<p>“Go it, Ferris; don’t let the boy beat you!”</p>

<p>“Show him what your long legs can do,
Darry!”</p>

<p>“Huzza! Darry is in the lead! He has left
Ferris behind!”</p>

<p>“See, see! Harry Parsons is crawling up!
He is neck and neck with Jack Ferris.”</p>

<p>It was true. While still fifty yards from the
finish Harry had gradually cut away the distance
between himself and the older runner.</p>

<p>Now the two were running side by side, with
Darry Ford but a few feet in advance.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ferris put on a burst of speed which
took him once more beside Darry Ford. Then
Harry spurted, and in a twinkling all three runners
were abreast.</p>

<p>“Here they come!”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a triple tie!”</p>

<p>“Look! look! Darry Ford is going ahead!”</p>

<p>“Harry Parsons is coming up with him!”</p>

<p>A dozen cries rang out, Joe shouting with the
rest. Harry heard nothing but a strange roaring
in his ears. He had passed Ferris, and now he
was beside Darry Ford. Then he put on his last
ounce of muscle and leaped to the front, passing
the line a winner by two yards, with Ford second,
and Ferris four yards further to the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“Whoop! Harry Parsons has won!”</p>

<p>“It was a plucky run for young Darry Ford!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Ferris; did your wind
give out?”</p>

<p>In the midst of the excitement Joe ran up and
caught Harry in his arms.</p>

<p>“I knew you could do it!” he exclaimed, his
face shining with joy. “I knew it.”</p>

<p>“It—it was a—a hard race,” panted Harry.
“Darry and Ferris shoved me to the limit of my
endurance.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what Luke Stout will say now,”
went on Joe. He tried to catch Stout’s eye, but
the fellow who had wagered his pocket knife on
Jack Ferris slunk out of sight behind his beaten
champion.</p>

<p>The crowd surrounded Harry, and insisted on
carrying him around the fort on their shoulders.
Then Andrew Leary gave him his choice of the
prizes, and Harry took the powder horn, for his
old one was cracked.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you took that,” said Darry Ford.
“I’ve been wanting a bullet-mold.”</p>

<p>“You ran well, Darry,” said Harry heartily.
“When you are as old as I am you’ll outrun me
without half trying.”</p>

<p>“I reckon it was something to best Ferris and
the rest,” answered Darry simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“Ferris stubbed his toe on some rocks,” put in
Luke Stout. “If it hadn’t been for that he
wouldn’t have dropped behind at the last
minute.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I won your knife fairly enough,
Luke,” came from Joe. “But as I still have my
own knife you can keep yours if you want it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t have to keep it,” responded Luke
Stout; nevertheless later on he gladly enough
took the knife back, saying he would square up
another time. But he never did.</p>

<p>More settlers were now coming into the territory,
and these included several old friends of the
Parsons family, so those at the log cabin did not
feel quite so lonely as before. Some of the settlers
put up at the fort, but others staked out
holdings up or down the river, and began to build
homes of their own without delay.</p>

<p>This was the greatest year in all American
history—the year 1776—when the colonies threw
off the English yoke and declared themselves
free and independent. News had already reached
the frontier of the skirmish at Lexington, the
battles of Concord and of Bunker Hill, and of
how Washington was holding the British troops
fast in Boston. Now came the news that the
redcoats were to evacuate Boston, and the settlers
at the fort went wild with excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“It is a great victory for our colonies,” said
Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>“It certainly means much,” said an officer
under him. “We now know something of our
own strength.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Daniel Boone was much disturbed
by the tidings that war with England was
a stern reality. It had been difficult in the past
to subdue the Indians, now it would be doubly
hard, for the red men would feel that the English
soldiers would no longer help the colonists,
and the colonists, having to fight the foe from
over the ocean, would be in no position to send
troops to the West to aid the settlers on the
frontier.</p>

<p>“They will dig up the war hatchet,” said
Boone. “For they will think they have us at
their mercy.” And his words proved true.</p>

<p>On the Fourth of July the Declaration of Independence
was signed at Philadelphia, amid the
ringing of bells, the blazing of bonfires, and the
loud shouting of the people. But this news did
not reach Boonesborough till sometime later, and
when something was happening which stirred the
settlers at and near the fort greatly.</p>

<p>At the fort lived a Colonel Callaway, who was
an intimate friend of Daniel Boone. Callaway
had two daughters, Betsey and Frances, both of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
whom were warm friends of Colonel Boone’s
daughter Jemima. All of the girls loved to play
in and near the water, and one day they got into
a canoe that was handy and began to paddle up
and down the river.</p>

<p>Nobody missed the merry party until a loud
shrieking from the other side of the stream caught
the ears of those who happened to be near the
river front. Looking across, they saw that the
girls had fallen into the clutches of a number of
red men.</p>

<p>“The Indians! The Indians!” was the cry.
And from all directions the settlers came pouring
toward the fort.</p>

<p>The matter was quickly explained, but nobody
dared to attempt crossing the river, believing that
a large party of the enemy must be concealed behind
the bushes. Colonels Boone and Callaway
were both away, and a messenger was sent post-haste
after them to acquaint them with the situation.</p>

<p>“So they have stolen my daughter, eh?” demanded
Daniel Boone, on hearing the news. He
said little more, but his eyes blazed with a determination
that meant much.</p>

<p>It was too late to follow the Indians that night,
but early in the morning Boone set off, taking
with him eight men, young and old. With this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
party went Joe, having asked permission of the
great hunter to go along.</p>

<p>“I will fight my best,” said Joe. “Please do
not refuse me. As you know, my mother is still
missing among the Indians, so you know how I
feel in a matter of this kind.”</p>

<p>The river was crossed at a point some distance
away from the fort, and it was not long before the
trail of the fleeing Indians, five or six in number,
was found among the cane-brake. It was rather
hard to follow this trail, and Daniel Boone cautioned
all to be careful how they moved forward.</p>

<p>“If the Indians find that they are being pursued,
they may murder the girls, and then run for
it,” he said. “We must save the girls unharmed
if we possibly can.”</p>

<p>It was hard walking through the brake, but
Joe was toughened to it, and did not murmur.
Boone went in advance, his eyes and ears as
keenly on guard as those of any Indian. Thus
nearly thirty miles were covered, with only a halt
for dinner. No fire was built, Boone being afraid
that the enemy might see the smoke.</p>

<p>Nightfall found the hunters in the midst of a
timber belt. They had gone on until even Boone
was tired out, and so rested, satisfied that they
would come up with the Indians sometime on the
morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>Joe was glad enough to rest, and hardly had his
head touched the ground than he sank into slumber,
from which he did not awaken until dawn.</p>

<p>A hasty breakfast was prepared and eaten, and
the little band of whites pushed forward once
more, Daniel Boone again in the lead, his rifle in
both hands, and his eyes on the trail.</p>

<p>“It is growing fresher,” he said presently.
And a moment later: “Here is where they encamped
for the night, and the girls with them.”</p>

<p>He was right, and, satisfied that they were now
but two hours behind the Indians on the trail,
they went on faster than ever. The route lay
along a buffalo path, and in many spots was
rough and uncertain.</p>

<p>It was almost noon when Boone, who was still
in advance, held up his hand for those behind
him to stop. All dropped low in the grass beside
the trail, and then the great hunter wormed his
way forward on his breast and stomach until he
reached the edge of a small opening beside a
brook that flowed into the river.</p>

<p>The sight that met his gaze thrilled him to the
heart. The Indians were there, having built a
tiny fire over which they were cooking their midday
meal. Close beside the fire, and sitting on a
log weeping bitterly, were the three girls that had
been made captives two days before.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>THE RESCUE OF JEMIMA BOONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel Boone</span> showed his years of wilderness
training when he did not at once raise a shout
and rush in to the rescue of his daughter and the
other girl captives of the Indians.</p>

<p>“I saw that two of the Indians over the fire
had their hunting knives in their hands,” he said
afterward, in telling of the situation. “They
were merciless wretches, and at the first sign of
peril would have turned and laid the girls low at
their feet, or else carried them off on their backs
as shields from our bullets.”</p>

<p>He moved back, and once among his companions
in the bushes gave directions how the
party should advance, and how all should fire at
the call of a certain wild bird—a call which
Boone could imitate to perfection.</p>

<p>Joe’s nerves were on a tension, for this was to
be a daring rush, and there was no telling how it
would end.</p>

<p>Cautiously all the members of the hunting party
moved forward as Colonel Boone had directed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
Joe was next to an old backwoodsman, John
Ford, the father of Darry, who had done so well
in the foot race.</p>

<p>There were several minutes of intense silence.
Daniel Boone was watching the Indians as a hawk
watches a brood of chickens. He was waiting
for the red men to move away from the captives.</p>

<p>Presently that moment came. Two of the Indians
left the fire to get more wood, and the
others were lying on the ground, conversing
earnestly together.</p>

<p>Loud and clear the cry of the wild bird pierced
the air, and an instant after came the crack of
Daniel Boone’s rifle, and one of the Indians fell.
Then came the cracks of the other rifles, and another
red man went down, and a third was
wounded in the side.</p>

<p>“At them, men!” cried Daniel Boone, and ran
forward, hunting knife in hand.</p>

<p>The Indians were taken by surprise, and, with
one man killed, one dying, and another wounded,
they imagined that a large force of whites had
come up.</p>

<p>“We must run!” said one quickly. “Run, or
we shall all be killed!” And they took to cover
without delay, and went crashing through the
forest and cane-brake until the sounds of their
retreat were lost in the distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“Father!” came from Jemima Boone, and in
her joy she ran and threw herself into her parent’s
arms. The Callaway girls were equally glad to
be rescued.</p>

<p>Some of the members of the party were anxious
to follow up the fleeing Indians and lay them all
low, but Daniel Boone objected.</p>

<p>“I think the best thing we can do is to get back
to the fort,” he said.</p>

<p>In his own mind Daniel Boone had come to
the conclusion that the Indians were preparing
for an early attack on the fort at Boonesborough.
Had he been asked for his reasons he could
scarcely have given them. To him it was “in the
air”—that feeling that sometimes come to one
as a forewarning of coming evil.</p>

<p>It was learned that the girls had been treated
fairly well by the Indians, for which the whites
were thankful. A midday meal was had of the
food the red men had been preparing, and after a
short rest the journey to the fort was begun.</p>

<p>So far the weather had been fair, but now it
began to cloud up, and a cold spring storm set in
which speedily wet the party thoroughly.</p>

<p>“We might as well go into camp,” said Daniel
Boone at three in the afternoon. “I know of a
fairly good shelter close by here,” and he led them
to where a clump of gnarled trees overhung a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
bank of rocks and dirt. Among these roots some
hunters had cleaned out an opening as large as a
fair-sized room, and here the girls were kept out
of the wet, while the men folks built a large camp-fire
at which to dry themselves.</p>

<p>Just above the first clump of trees was a second,
and after the camp-fire was lit, Joe and John
Ford moved to the spot to see if they could not
fix up some sort of shelter for themselves for the
night.</p>

<p>“It will be better than lying out under the
trees in the rain,” said John Ford. “I’ve had a
bit of rheumatism the past winter, and I do not
want more of it.”</p>

<p>The hollow under the trees was filled with
sticks and dead leaves, and both Joe and the
backwoodsman had to work for some time cleaning
out the place.</p>

<p>Joe was bending close to the ground, and had
a bunch of sticks in one hand when he heard a
hiss to one side of him. He started, and on the
instant saw a rattlesnake glide from among the
roots of the tree, and glare at him with its beady
eyes.</p>

<p>“A snake!” roared John Ford, and tumbled
out of the opening without delay.</p>

<p>Joe started to follow his companion. But as he
turned his foot caught in a rope-like root, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
down he pitched headlong on his face. When he
sat up the rattlesnake had shifted its position, and
rested directly between the young pioneer and the
open air.</p>

<p>There was no denying the fact that Joe was
scared. The rattlesnake was large, and the youth
had often heard of the fatal effects of a rattlesnake
bite.</p>

<p>What to do he did not know. If he ran for the
open air he would have to pass close to the reptile,
and a jump over the snake was out of the
question, owing to the closeness of the tree roots
overhead.</p>

<p>It was John Ford who gave him a bit of good
advice.</p>

<p>“Jump up, lad, and catch the roots!” he sang
out. “I’ll get my gun.”</p>

<p>As Ford uttered the words the rattlesnake prepared
to strike at Joe. Up went the youth, and
not only caught the roots over his head with his
hands, but also with his feet, drawing up his
body as far as possible.</p>

<p>The rattlesnake leaped high in making its
strike, but the fangs merely grazed the lower end
of Joe’s hunting shirt. Then it hissed again, and
prepared to climb the roots from the rear of the
opening under the trees.</p>

<p>As the snake passed to the rear of the opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
Joe swung himself down and made a leap forward
to where John Ford had just reached for
his gun.</p>

<p>Bang! went the weapon of the backwoodsman.
His aim was uncertain, and the rattlesnake
was merely struck on the tail, a wound that
caused it to become more enraged than ever.
There was another hiss, and then the reptile came
straight for Ford, its eyes gleaming more venomously
than before.</p>

<p>By this time Joe had his gun at hand. Luckily
the weapon was loaded with shot, and the youth
had taken care to keep the priming dry. He took
hasty aim and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>As the report of the gun sounded out, the head
of the rattlesnake was seen to fly into half a dozen
pieces. The body whipped in one direction and
another, and it was a long time before it straightened
out and lay still.</p>

<p>“A good shot!” cried John Ford. “And in
the nick of time, too!”</p>

<p>The reports of the two guns brought all of the
others in the camp hurrying in that direction,
thinking there might be another attack of the Indians.</p>

<p>“You are well out of that, lad,” said Daniel
Boone, on examining the body of the snake.
“He was a bad one. Did he strike you at all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“No, but he hit the end of my hunting shirt,”
answered Joe.</p>

<p>“If that is so, be careful not to touch the spot
and you had better soak it in brandy or cut it
out.”</p>

<p>“I would cut it out,” put in John Ford.
“Soaking may take out the poison, and it may
not. I once knew a man who got a rattlesnake
fang in his boot. He soaked it in rum for two
days, and yet, later on, when he used the boot,
it made his foot swell up as if he had been bitten
by a nest of hornets.”</p>

<p>“I’ll cut the place out,” said Joe, and he did,
without further loss of time. Nobody cared to
go near the clump of trees after that, fearing
more snakes, and Joe and Ford found shelter
with some of the other hunters at the camp-fire.</p>

<p>It was a cold and disagreeable night, and Joe
slept but little. Yet the youth was thankful that
he had escaped from the snake, and when he said
his prayers on retiring he did not forget to thank
God for all His many mercies.</p>

<p>In the morning, the sun came out as brightly
as ever, and by eight o’clock the journey to the
fort was resumed. It passed without special incident,
and twenty-four hours later saw Joe once
again at home, and rather glad that the brief campaign
against the Indians was at an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>Acting on instructions from his superiors,
Daniel Boone now released the Indian chief Red
Feather, and gave to him the gifts that had been
promised. He also released Yellow Blanket, and
told both red men that he trusted the war between
the Indians and the whites was at an end, and
that henceforth all would dwell in peace.</p>

<p>“The white man has come here to till the
soil,” said Boone to Red Feather. “The Indian
lives by the hunt. Let each go his way, and when
the winter comes let the Indian bring to the white
man the meat of the buffalo and other game, and
he shall receive in return flour, and hay for his
horse, and such other things as he needs.”</p>

<p>“It is well spoken—the war is at an end,” said
Red Feather, and so departed, and Yellow
Blanket followed him.</p>

<p>It was not known until long after that Red
Feather intended fully to keep his promise to remain
friendly to the whites. Even Daniel Boone
did not believe the Indian chief, for he knew
much of red men’s treachery. But Red Feather
went straight to the Indian villages and told of
what Daniel Boone had said.</p>

<p>“He is a noble brave,” said Red Feather. “If
we remain friendly to him he will surely treat us
well.”</p>

<p>This speech enraged Long Knife, who was now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
recovered from the arrow wound Joe inflicted,
and he made a long speech in return, in which he
insinuated that the whites had bribed Red
Feather to friendliness. This provoked a quarrel
and a fight, in the midst of which Red Feather
was shot down by some treacherous follower of
Long Knife.</p>

<p>“Red Feather deserved the fate,” said Long
Knife, after the excitement was over. “He was
untrue to the red man. The land is ours, and I
will not sit down and see the white man occupy
it.”</p>

<p>“Long Knife speaks well,” said Yellow
Blanket. “I, too, was a prisoner of the whites,
but I made them no promises. I will fight them
to the bitter end. Yellow Blanket has spoken.”</p>

<p>“Yellow Blanket has uncovered a heart of
gold,” said Long Knife. “He is a true friend to
the Indian. He shall stand beside me when we
go into battle against the whites. We shall make
every paleface bite the dust before this war is at
an end.”</p>

<p>On the day following this talk, another was
held, and it was decided that all of the Indians
should henceforth serve under the leadership of
Long Knife, and that there should be no let-up to
the warfare until all of the white settlers were
driven from the soil of Kentucky, and their cabins
and forts razed to the ground.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>A NIGHT RAID BY THE INDIANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> weeks later Mrs. Parsons was at the
spring getting a bucket of water when, without
warning, an arrow came whizzing in her direction,
and buried itself in the ground close by.</p>

<p>With a shriek the good woman let fall her
bucket and rushed for the cabin, shrieking that
the Indians were at hand.</p>

<p>“The Indians!” cried Harmony, who had her
hands deep in a batch of dough she was kneading.</p>

<p>“Yes, the Indians!” panted the Quakeress.
“They just shot an arrow at me. Get thee gone,
Cora, and tell Harry and thy brother.”</p>

<p>Cora needed no second notice, but leaping up
from her spinning frame rushed to the opposite
side of the cabin, where Joe and Harry were
working in the garden.</p>

<p>“The Indians! the Indians!” she called loudly.
“Come into the house!”</p>

<p>At the announcement both young pioneers
dropped their garden tools and caught up their
muskets, leaning against a stone wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>“Where are they?” demanded Harry, who
was the first to reach the cabin.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But one shot an arrow at your
mother.”</p>

<p>“Mother, are you hurt?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer. “But the arrow
came close to me. See, there it is,” and she
pointed it out with her hand.</p>

<p>“I see the Indian!” cried Harry, and pointed
to the distant forest. A red man had crossed an
open place on a run.</p>

<p>Eagerly those in the cabin watched for the reappearance
of the Indian, and in the meantime all
armed themselves, the boys with their rifles, Mrs.
Parsons with a shotgun, and the girls with pistols.
The outer doors of the cabin were closed
and barred, and also the windows, leaving only
the loopholes open.</p>

<p>“It must mean an uprising,” said Joe, who had
his eye glued to a loophole on one side of the
cabin, while Harry kept guard at a loophole opposite.</p>

<p>“This is some of Red Feather’s work,” came
from Harry bitterly. “I knew it was a mistake
to let him go.”</p>

<p>“More than likely Yellow Blanket has got
Long Knife to make the attack,” answered Joe.</p>

<p>Ten minutes went by, and they saw nothing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
the Indians. Then a yell from a distance rent the
air, followed by a number of scattering shots.</p>

<p>“That is over to the Ford cabin,” said Joe.
“I hope they haven’t caught Mr. Ford and Darry
in the open. If they have it’s good-by to them.”</p>

<p>“I’m going up to the roof to take a look
around,” said Harry, and lost no time in climbing
the ladder to the loft.</p>

<p>The roof was a sloping one, and near the ridge
was a trapdoor or scuttle. Standing on a block
of wood that was handy, Harry raised the trapdoor
and looked out.</p>

<p>Hardly had he done so than there followed the
flight of two arrows directed at him. One struck
the roof just below the lad, and the other grazed
his hair. He tumbled back and let the trapdoor
fall into place with a bang.</p>

<p>“See anything?” queried Joe from below.</p>

<p>“All I want to,” answered Harry, when he
could recover sufficiently to speak.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Two of the wretches fired arrows at me, and
they came altogether too close for comfort.”</p>

<p>“Phew! Then this cabin is being watched
surely, Harry!”</p>

<p>“Be careful, my son,” pleaded Mrs. Parsons.
“Thee must not expose thyself again.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to,” answered Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>Once more the young pioneer took his station
at a loophole. He and Joe were at opposite sides
of the living room, while Mrs. Parsons and the
girls were on the watch from the bedchambers.</p>

<p>“How much water have we on hand?” asked
Joe, presently.</p>

<p>“The cask is full,” answered Harmony. “I
looked only this morning.”</p>

<p>She referred to a cask that had been sunk under
the living room floor sometime before. This
cask had been fitted with a cover, and the water
in it was changed once a week by either Joe or
Harry. It was not used ordinarily, but had been
placed there for possible use in just such an
emergency as now seemed at hand.</p>

<p>“Do you—do you think they’ll keep on the
watch until to-night?” faltered Cora.</p>

<p>“Possibly—unless they are defeated in other
directions,” answered Joe.</p>

<p>Slowly an hour went by, and still none of the
red men appeared. Twice they heard rifle-shots
at a great distance, but that was all.</p>

<p>“They seem to have moved in another direction,”
said Harry.</p>

<p>“Don’t give up watching,” was his chum’s
caution.</p>

<p>A little later they heard a dozen or more shots
in the direction of the fort. Then came a yell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
and more shots lasting the best part of a quarter
of an hour.</p>

<p>“I see an Indian!” cried Harmony, later still.
“He is crossing the clearing where you cut down
the last tree.”</p>

<p>Both Joe and Harry rushed to look, but before
they could get an eye at the loophole the enemy
had disappeared.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to continue on guard,” said Joe.
“Those wretches wouldn’t like anything better
than to catch us unawares.”</p>

<p>The first alarm had come shortly after midday,
and the balance of the afternoon wore away
slowly. To relieve the monotony of the lookout,
those on guard shifted from one loophole to
another. When it grew dark Mrs. Parsons prepared
a hasty supper.</p>

<p>“We had best eat now,” she said. “Later on
there may not be a chance.”</p>

<p>Although outwardly calm, each person in the
cabin was tremendously excited. The girls were
particularly nervous, for they well knew what
capture by the Indians might mean.</p>

<p>“I’d rather die first,” whispered Harmony to
her sister.</p>

<p>“So would I,” Cora answered. And then they
both thought of their mother and of Clara Parsons.
Where were these loved ones now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“If they are going to attack at all it will be
to-night,” said Joe. “We’ll have to remain on
guard until morning.”</p>

<p>Slowly the mantle of night fell. The Indians
had timed their raid on the settlement well. There
was no moon, and the drifting clouds cut off
many of the stars.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons’ eyesight was not of the best, and
it was decided that Joe and Cora were to take up
the first watch, lasting three hours, and were then
to give place to Harry and Harmony for the next
three hours. This would give each a much
needed rest, for to watch at a loophole proved
very tiring both to eyes and nerves.</p>

<p>With the coming of night all became silent
around the cabin. No candles were lit and all
the lower cracks in the cabin logs were covered
by having articles of furniture placed against
them. Thus it would be impossible for the Indians
to look inside, even if they came up close
to the building.</p>

<p>An ordinary eye would have distinguished little
outside during that watch. But Joe’s eye was
trained by constant usage, and he made a note
of many things—the flight of birds and the slinking
of a fox across one of the clearings.</p>

<p>The sight of the fox was a little cheering. “If
he can sneak around the Indians must be pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
far away,” was the way the young pioneer
reasoned.</p>

<p>At last Joe’s watch came to an end, and he and
Cora laid down to rest, leaving Harry and Harmony
on guard. Then another hour dragged by,
seeming little short of an age.</p>

<p>Harmony had just uttered a long sigh of weariness
when something caught her eye and caused
her to become once again on the alert. Something
was moving among the trees nearest to the
cabin.</p>

<p>“I see something!” she whispered. “Whether
it is an Indian, or a white man, or an animal, I
cannot tell.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take no chances,” said Harry, and ran
to the loophole, at the same time rousing Joe and
the others.</p>

<p>It was an Indian Harmony had seen. He was
now behind a tree, but soon they saw him come
forth once more, drop into the grass, and worm
his way along toward the cabin.</p>

<p>“He is coming this way,” cried Harry softly.</p>

<p>“Alone?” queried Joe.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then give him a shot, as soon as he is in
range.”</p>

<p>“Be sure he is an Indian,” came from Mrs.
Parsons. “You do not want to shoot a friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“A friend would come forward boldly,” answered
Joe.</p>

<p>Trembling with excitement, Harry pushed the
muzzle of his rifle through the loophole. Then
he took careful aim at the uncertain figure in the
grass and fired.</p>

<p>There was a shriek of pain and the red enemy
leaped up and swung around one arm as if in intense
pain. Then he dropped down again and
loped back to the protection of the forest.</p>

<p>“I hit him—but I didn’t kill him,” said Harry,
as he pulled in his smoking firearm; and then he
set to work to reload the rifle with all speed.</p>

<p>Once more they went on watch, and slowly the
minutes went by. Then Joe suddenly thrust out
his gun-barrel and discharged the weapon.</p>

<p>Another yell followed, and an Indian who had
been in hiding behind the stone wall of the garden
fell forward, shot through the shoulder.
But he, too, managed to crawl away and disappeared
into the forest.</p>

<p>This was the last of the alarms. Evidently
the Indians imagined the cabin well protected,
and they did not dare to make a rush. Slowly
the morning dawned, and hardly had the sun
peeped over the trees than they saw Daniel Boone
riding toward the cabin at full speed, followed
by half a dozen frontiersmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“Hurrah, here is Colonel Boone!” cried Joe,
and he threw open the door to receive the great
hunter.</p>

<p>“Are you all safe here?” demanded Boone,
with a quick glance around.</p>

<p>“Yes, we are all safe,” answered Harry; “but
we have had a pretty hard night of it,” and he
told their story.</p>

<p>“The Indians attacked seven of the cabins in
this settlement and some cabins further off,” said
Daniel Boone. “A small party of ’em also came
to the fort. But we have sent them about their
business with the loss of but one man—old
Wimbley—who was brutally murdered in the
woods. Three of the redskins were killed in the
various fights and there are probably a dozen
wounded.”</p>

<p>“Who led the raid, do you know that?” asked
Joe.</p>

<p>“Long Knife. He is now at the head of all
the tribes in this neighborhood. Red Feather is
dead.”</p>

<p>Daniel Boone was out rounding up the settlers
to go after the Indians. Joe readily agreed to
go along, leaving Harry to watch over those at
the log cabin.</p>

<p>“Take care of yourself, Joe,” said Harry, as
the pair parted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“And you take care of yourself and the others,
Harry,” was the answer.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon before the settlers started
out, sixty-five strong, and led by Colonel Boone.
Each man carried a rifle and plenty of ammunition,
and in addition rations for two days. If
more food was needed the settlers felt that they
could easily supply themselves from the game in
the forest and the plenteous fish in the numerous
streams.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>IN A FOREST FIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> period has well been called the “dark
and bloody” years of life in Kentucky. Raids
by the Indians occurred frequently, not only at
Boonesborough, but also at the other settlements,
until more than one pioneer became so disheartened
that he gave up the contest and returned
to the East.</p>

<p>The war with England was at its height and the
red men knew that it was impossible for the colonists
to send any troops to the West to subdue
them. More than this, the English were only too
glad to give the Indians a hand against the settlers
at every opportunity.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone felt that a stand must be taken,
and the Indians must be taught a lesson they
would not readily forget. He was very silent
on the march, but his head was busy with his
plans.</p>

<p>“I reckon he means business this trip,” observed
Joe to one of the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“That he does, lad,” answered the pioneer.
“And can you blame him?”</p>

<p>“Blame him? No, indeed, Mr. Pembly. We
have good cause to bring the redskins to terms.”</p>

<p>“To my mind we have a hard fight afore us,”
went on Andrew Pembly. “The Injuns must
know we are after ’em.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not.”</p>

<p>The way was rough, and more than once the
party had to make a détour, to avoid some great
fallen monarch of the forest, or get out of the
way of some sharp rocks next to impossible to
climb over.</p>

<p>The pioneers did not keep very close together,
and presently Joe found himself in the company
of three others on the side of a little cliff fronting
a small gully thick with brushwood and
weeds.</p>

<p>Joe had dropped a little behind, and was on
the point of starting to catch up when he heard
a faint sound in the gully.</p>

<p>“What was that?” was the question he asked
himself.</p>

<p>Instantly he thought of but two things, a wild
animal or an Indian. The sound must have come
from one or the other.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to investigate,” he reasoned.</p>

<p>He would have called to his companions, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
they had gone ahead, and were out of sight
around the end of the little cliff.</p>

<p>“If I call out loud it may serve as a warning
to some enemy,” he thought.</p>

<p>Gun in hand, he stepped nearer to the gully,
and peered searchingly among the brushwood
and weeds.</p>

<p>At first he could see nothing, but at last he
made out a dark object lying in the midst of a
clump of bushes.</p>

<p>“A man, or I am greatly mistaken,” he told
himself. “But if he is a white man, what is he
doing there?”</p>

<p>Not to be taken by surprise, Joe dropped into
the bushes himself, expecting to crawl away and
tell his friends of his discovery.</p>

<p>But just as he was on the point of leaving the
spot he heard the man below give a prolonged
groan.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” he murmured feebly. “For
the sake of Heaven, help me!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you?” called out
the youth.</p>

<p>“An English voice! Heaven be praised.
Help me, please!”</p>

<p>“I say, what is the matter with you?” repeated
the young pioneer.</p>

<p>“I am badly wounded in the leg. I have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
in this dismal hole three days, and I am half
starved. Help me!”</p>

<p>“I certainly will,” answered Joe, and went
forward boldly, although with his gun ready for
use, in case of possible treachery.</p>

<p>As he got closer to the sufferer he recognized
the man as a hunter named Brinker, one who had
spent considerable time at Boonesborough the
year before. The hunter was indeed in a sad
plight, and with him walking was entirely out
of the question. All that had passed his lips for
three days was a biscuit he had happened to have
in his game bag, and some water he had found
in a nearby hollow.</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly are in a bad fix,” said
Joe kindly. “Wait until I tell some of the others,
and then we’ll try and do what we can for
you.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t go away too far,” pleaded
Brinker.</p>

<p>“I shall not.”</p>

<p>Joe ran forward with all speed, and soon caught
up to those who had gone ahead. He reported
what he had discovered, and four men went back
with him to Brinker’s assistance.</p>

<p>When they reached the sufferer they found he
had fainted from exhaustion, and it took tender
nursing to bring him around. His wound was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
washed and bound up, and he was given some
liquor.</p>

<p>“I’m downright glad you came,” he said, when
he could speak again. “I don’t reckon as how I
could have held out another day.”</p>

<p>“How came you there, Brinker?” asked
Daniel Boone, who had come up to interview
the man.</p>

<p>“It’s a long story, Colonel. I was out hunting
deer when I ran into a party of eighteen or twenty
redskins. They were encamped in a hollow, and
I came on ’em before I knew what was up.”</p>

<p>“And they started to capture you?”</p>

<p>“Three of ’em did capture me, but I knocked
one of ’em over and broke away. They fired on
me, and one shot passed through my hair.” The
hunter pointed to where several locks had been
cut away. “It was a close hair-cut, Colonel.”</p>

<p>“But how did you get hit in the leg?”</p>

<p>“That came later. I got away, as I said, and
hid in a hollow log. But the redskins followed
my trail, and I had to leave the log and take to
the woods. When I came out on the cliff one of
’em took a long shot at me with a rifle, and hit
me as you see. I fell off the cliff, and nearly broke
my other leg doing it. Then I crawled into the
bushes and laid low. They tramped all around
the spot, but good luck was with me, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
passed me by. They might have remained around
here only, I reckon, they knew you were on the
trail,” concluded Brinker.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to send you back to the fort,” said
Colonel Boone. “You are not fit to go forward
with us.”</p>

<p>“Can you send me back?”</p>

<p>“I think so. There are two others going back.
They can take you.”</p>

<p>Brinker was then questioned concerning the
Indians he had encountered. He said they were
part of Long Knife’s warriors, but that the chief
had not been with them.</p>

<p>“They had two captives with them,” he continued.</p>

<p>“Two captives!” exclaimed Joe. “Who were
they?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t git a good look at ’em, lad. They
were a man and a woman.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the woman was my mother.”</p>

<p>“Is your mother missing?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t see the woman very closely.
Fact is, I had all I could do to get away. They
wanted to either kill or capture me the worst
way,” added Brinker.</p>

<p>“Then you can’t describe the prisoners at all?”</p>

<p>“The man was tall, and looked rather old.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
The woman was sitting down, and had her back
to me, so I can’t tell how tall she was, or how
she looked.”</p>

<p>This was all Brinker could tell, and he was so
weak that to make him talk more would have been
cruel. He was placed in charge of a pioneer who
had once served as a nurse in an army hospital,
and later on returned to Boonesborough with the
others Colonel Boone had mentioned.</p>

<p>“He can be thankful he escaped with his life,”
said Joe to Andrew Pembly.</p>

<p>“He can thank you for finding him,” answered
the pioneer. “Had you passed him by he would
most likely have died in the hollow.”</p>

<p>“I wish he had seen that woman who was a
captive.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it was your mother, Joe. She
is probably miles and miles away from here.”</p>

<p>“That is true. But she might have heard something
of my mother—through the Indians.”</p>

<p>“’Taint likely—the redskins won’t tell much
about their prisoners. They are too afraid of
having their captives followed up by friends.”</p>

<p>The march was once more forward, over a
stretch of ground thick with thorny underbrush
where more than one hunting garb became badly
torn. Here Joe took two tumbles, and scratched
both his hands and his face. But he did not complain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
knowing that many of his companions were
in a similar plight.</p>

<p>At the end of the day the hunters found themselves
on the bank of a stream that flowed into
the main river a dozen miles away. It was an
ideal spot for resting, and a long and careful
search revealed no Indians in the immediate
vicinity.</p>

<p>Nothing came to disturb the camp that night,
although a strict watch was kept, and by daybreak
the hunters were again on the march. Soon
they struck the trail of the Indians, and Daniel
Boone calculated that the enemy were not less
than two hundred in number. Only a few were
on horseback.</p>

<p>As the hunters advanced scouts were sent out
ahead, and presently two of these came running
back with the information that the Indians were
making for a long valley straight ahead.</p>

<p>“That is Bear Valley,” said Daniel Boone.
“I know it well. Beyond is a heavy forest. If
they reach that they will surely get away. We
must try to come up to them before the end of the
valley is reached.”</p>

<p>It was a hot, dry day, but a lively breeze was
blowing, which made the air seem somewhat
cooler than it really was. The breeze had been
on the hunters’ backs, but now it began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
swerve around until it came almost from their
front.</p>

<p>More than half the valley had been traveled
when the hunters came to a somewhat narrow
pass, hemmed in with hemlocks and cedars, and
large quantities of small brush. As they entered
this pass Boone suddenly called a halt.</p>

<p>“Stop, men!” came in a loud voice, and then
he continued, “What do you smell?”</p>

<p>“Smoke!” came promptly from a dozen of
the party.</p>

<p>“It’s coming from the left, colonel.”</p>

<p>“It’s coming from dead ahead.”</p>

<p>“I believe they have set the forest on fire,”
went on Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>“That is just what they have,” cried one old
frontiersman. “And set it on fire in half a
dozen places, too!”</p>

<p>The hunters could now see the smoke plainly.
It came from ahead and from both sides of the
valley. The brisk breeze was fanning the flames,
which spread with marvelous rapidity.</p>

<p>“They want to hem us in,” said Colonel Boone.
“Well, we’ll see if they are able to do it.”</p>

<p>The Indians were shouting defiance to their
enemies. They had withdrawn to the sides of
the valley, and now they sent in a dozen or more
shots from the few rifles they possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>With fire ahead and on both sides, there was
nothing to do but retreat, and, much as he
hated to give the order, Boone told his men to
fall back.</p>

<p>“We can circle the hill on our left,” he said.
“I know a deer trail running to the river ahead.”</p>

<p>The whole party turned and began to retrace
their steps. The smoke was thick about them,
and the breeze began to send the burning embers
flying in all directions.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we’ll be able to get out of this
alive,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“We’ll be all right unless the redskins have
set fire to the brush behind us,” answered one of
the hunters.</p>

<p>None of the party lost time in turning back.
The breeze was increasing, and soon the thick
smoke swept downward, filling the narrow valley
from end to end.</p>

<p>“Oh, but this is awful!” gasped Joe, and then
began to cough.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop, men!” shouted Daniel Boone.
“Don’t stop, or it may be the death of you!”</p>

<p>With so many men crowding the narrow trail,
progress was not near as rapid as it might otherwise
have been, and long before the back end
of the valley was gained more than one settler
was ready to drop from the effects of the smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>Joe went on half blindly, the tears running
from his eyes. He knew that the fire was sweeping
down from the other end of the valley, and
that the breeze would soon carry it in their very
midst unless they made a rapid escape.</p>

<p>He was almost ready to drop, when the wind
shifted, and for a minute gave him and the
others a draught of fresh air. This revived all
of the hunters, and they pushed onward with renewed
energy.</p>

<p>“If we ever git out o’ this air trap, them redskins
shall pay dearly fer the trick,” announced
one old frontiersman, and many of the party
agreed with him.</p>

<p>The wind was shifting to the other end of the
valley, and now came a cry from ahead that
caused every heart in the party to jump with
renewed fear.</p>

<p>“They have set fire to this end of the valley,
too! We are hemmed in by the flames!”</p>

<p>The report was true. Some of the Indians had
secreted themselves in the bushes, and they had
not been discovered by the guards sent out by
Boone. As soon as the whites had passed, they
had set fire to some bushes in the vicinity, and
then ran around to the front by means of a narrow
trail which was well known to them leading
over one of the hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>“We’ll have to make a dash right through the
fire, I am afraid,” said Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>“Unless we can find some spot where the
bushes haven’t caught yet,” said another old
hunter.</p>

<p>“Here is a small brook!” cried a third. “I’m
going to souse myself in that.”</p>

<p>This last suggestion was considered good, and
in a twinkling all of the party had leaped into
the brook and wet themselves from head to
feet.</p>

<p>It was well that they did this, for the burning
embers were now blowing about more thickly
than ever. Joe caught some of the fire on his
neck and some on his left hand, and his eyebrows
were singed.</p>

<p>It was now a mad rush, each man for himself.
The crowd had scattered to the right and the
left of two patches of brushwood that were blazing
fiercely.</p>

<p>At last Joe found himself face to face with the
belt of fire. It stretched far to the left and the
right.</p>

<p>“No loophole there,” he thought grimly, but
a moment later saw a spot where the brushwood
had already burnt to the ground. The spot was
a hundred feet wide and still hot and smoking,
yet he did not hesitate, but leaped over it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
with the best rate of speed that he could command.</p>

<p>With his eyes half filled with smoke, the young
pioneer could see but little, and consequently he
did not notice a sink-hole in the very center of
the burnt-over tract. Down he went into this
morass up to his waist, and there he stuck as
firmly as if in so much glue.</p>

<p>It was a moment of peril, and it must be admitted
that Joe’s heart sank within him. The
smoke was rolling all around him, and he expected
to be smothered in short order. In vain
he tugged to get of the sink-hole. The more he
tried the deeper he appeared to sink.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” he cried, with all the vigor that
he could command. “Help! I am fast in a sink-hole!”</p>

<p>Again and again he cried out, but nobody appeared
to hear him, and through the drifting and
swirling smoke he could see next to nothing.</p>

<p>In the meantime the hunters were rushing in
half a dozen directions. The majority were following
the watercourse, and by bending low in
this they managed to pass the belt of fire. The
Indians had piled some brushwood over the
stream and set it on fire, but this was kicked away
by the running settlers.</p>

<p>Joe felt his senses leaving him, when he fancied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
he saw a man running close to where he was held
a prisoner.</p>

<p>“Help!” he called feebly. “Please help me!”</p>

<p>“Who calls?” came back, in a thick voice, as
though the speaker himself could scarcely use
his voice.</p>

<p>“It is I, Joe Winship. I am fast in a sink-hole.
Help me!”</p>

<p>“Where are you, Joe?” and now the lad recognized
the voice of Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>“Here! Oh, Colonel Boone, save me!”</p>

<p>The form came closer, and presently Joe saw
Boone. The young pioneer stretched out his arms
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Hullo, this is a bad fix,” murmured Boone,
as he took in the situation at a glance.</p>

<p>Coming to the edge of the sink-hole he placed
his feet on the firmest spot to be found, and then
caught Joe under the arms. A long, hard pull,
that made the lad think he was going to be disjointed,
followed, and then up he came.</p>

<p>“Can you stand?” asked Daniel Boone, and
then as he saw the boy falter, he caught up the
body, slung it over his shoulder, and made off
amid the smoke and the flying embers.</p>

<p>In another five minutes both Boone and Joe
were out of danger. They had reached a spot a
fair distance from the burning forest, and each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
squatted in the brook up to their armpits and
washed their flushed and scorched faces and
hands in the cool liquid. About half of the
party that had gone out after the Indians were
doing the same. What had become of the other
hunters nobody knew.</p>

<p>It was not until nightfall that Daniel Boone
was able to get his men together again. It was
found that one had been burnt up by the fire, and
half a dozen seriously injured. Three Indians
had been shot, but the others had departed for
parts unknown.</p>

<p>The body of the dead man had to be taken
back to the settlement, and the wounded cared
for, so that immediate pursuit of the Indians was
out of the question—and, indeed, nobody of the
party just then felt like moving. The smoke in
the valley was as thick as ever, and this now
covered both hills.</p>

<p>“We will go into camp here,” said Colonel
Boone, and this was done, and the pioneers rested
for the best part of a week. During those days
the injured returned home, and ten other settlers
came from another settlement to take their
places.</p>

<p>On the eighth day the men under Boone prepared
to move forward once again. A heavy
rain had drowned out the forest fire, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
trail over one of the hills was found to be perfectly
safe to travel.</p>

<p>The order to march had just been given when
one of the sharpshooters who was in advance
came running back with news of importance.</p>

<p>“A body of white men are approaching!” he
cried. “And unless I am greatly mistaken they
are the men who left the fort last fall to see if
they couldn’t rescue the captives the Indians took
at that time.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>THE ATTACK ON THE FORT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My</span> father must be with that party!”</p>

<p>Such was the thought which rushed into Joe’s
mind when he heard the announcement made by
the sharpshooter.</p>

<p>The news created a stir among the followers
of Daniel Boone, and all of the party hurried
forward to meet the newcomers.</p>

<p>The other party looked travel-stained and
weary. Their hunting garbs were almost reduced
to rags, and more than one was suffering from
wounds.</p>

<p>Joe looked at the men eagerly, and his heart
fell when he realized that neither his father nor
Mr. Parsons was among them.</p>

<p>“We have had a long, hard siege of it,” said
one of the hunters. “We have had half a dozen
battles with the redskins and had a last brush
with them day before yesterday while on our
way to this spot. They seemed to be coming
from here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“That must have been the band that set fire
to this forest,” said Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>From one of the hunters, old Pep Frost, Joe obtained
the particulars of the advance on the
Indians.</p>

<p>“We had two fights with ’em afore winter
closed in on us,” said Frost. “Then we went into
quarters on the sunny side o’ a cliff and went to
shootin’ game to keep us alive.”</p>

<p>“But what of my father and of Mr. Parsons?”
asked Joe impatiently. “And did you see
anything of my mother and Clara Parsons?”</p>

<p>“One question at a time, lad. Yes, we saw
both your mother and Clara Parsons, and two
other captives, and we got ’em all away from the
Injuns. That was a month ago. But two days
later the redskins came down on us stronger nor
ever and took the captives back. Your father and
Mr. Parsons were fer following ’em up at once,
and did so—an’ thet’s the last any o’ us saw
o’ ’em.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t know what has become of
my father?”</p>

<p>“Nuthin’ further nor thet, Joey. It’s too bad,
but I can’t give ye nuthin’ but the truth,” answered
Pep Frost.</p>

<p>It was a great blow, and, coming after such a
long wait, was doubly telling. The young pioneer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
covered his face with his hands and gave a
long, deep sigh.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what the folks at home will say
of this,” he remarked, after a silence.</p>

<p>“I am truly sorry for ye, Joey, indeed I am.
Let us hope it all turns out for the best.”</p>

<p>Again the party under Daniel Boone went forward,
and two days later a small part of the Indians
under Long Knife were engaged. Joe was in
the thick of this contest, and had the satisfaction
of bringing down one Indian, who was afterward
finished by Boone with a hunting knife.</p>

<p>This was the end of the pursuit. From one of
the Indians it was learned that another attack was
contemplated on the fort at Boonesborough, and
so the settlers returned to that vicinity, unwilling
to remain away and leave the fort and the homesteads
unprotected.</p>

<p>When Joe came back with the news brought in
by Pep Frost and the others who had gone away
the year before, there was a good deal of crying
on the part of Mrs. Parsons and Harmony and
Cora.</p>

<p>“The hand of Providence is surely against us,”
said the Quakeress. “We have done wrong by
coming here and settling on the lands of the Indians.
Would that the others were back once more,
and that we might return to the East.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>Harry had but little to say, but Joe understood
his chum.</p>

<p>“It’s awful,” said Joe, when the two were alone
in the garden. “I can’t imagine what is going to
happen next.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” returned Harry. “Perhaps mother
is right and we did wrong to settle on these
lands.”</p>

<p>“No. I can’t believe that. If we didn’t come,
others would. There will be cities and towns
without number here some day, Harry.”</p>

<p>The threatened attack on the fort at Boonesborough
did not take place, for Long Knife was
afraid to march against the garrison now stationed
there. But other settlements were visited,
and during that summer and winter eight settlers
were killed by the red men. More than two
dozen families grew utterly discouraged and sold
off their belongings for a song and returned to
the East.</p>

<p>It was a dark winter all around—dark for
these pioneers who had done so much to make a
home for themselves in the wilderness, and
doubly dark for the ragged and ill-fed army under
General Washington who were doing their best
to drive the soldiers of England from American
soil.</p>

<p>As the winter passed away the Indians grew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
bolder, and hardly a week passed that they did not
raid some settlement. Sometimes they only drove
away the horses and cattle, but often they would
kill and scalp every man, woman, and child they
could lay their hands upon. The battles were
not always one-sided, and twice the Indians were
surrounded and fully a score of them were killed
or made prisoners.</p>

<p>During those days it was almost impossible to
do much around the cabin home. When the boys
worked in the garden—for the time to plow
was now at hand—they had their firearms close
by, ready for use, and when they went to the
forest for wood, they always surveyed the locality
with care and retreated to the cabin at the
first indication of danger.</p>

<p>Inside the cabin it was the same. A rifle stood
behind the door loaded all the time, and neither
Mrs. Parsons nor the girls thought of going to
the spring for a bucket of water unless they were
satisfied the coast was clear. Often the various
inmates of the cabin would stand watch during
the night, fearing a raid or another attempt to
burn the home over their heads.</p>

<p>“We can’t stand this very long,” remarked Joe
one day. “I’m getting to be as nervous as a
cat.”</p>

<p>“I am the same,” answered Harry. “Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
sound makes me jump as if a pistol had exploded
at my ear.”</p>

<p>“If only father would come home—and your
father and the others.”</p>

<p>That was always the way their talk ended—if
only the others would return. And it made them
heartsick beyond description.</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t for the women folks we could go
on a hunt for them,” said Joe. “But it wouldn’t
be right to leave them here alone.”</p>

<p>This was in the early spring, and a few days
later a scout came in with the information that the
Indians were once more gathering for an attack
on the fort.</p>

<p>At once messengers were sent in all directions,
and the settlers were told to hasten into Boonesborough
without delay. Some few remained at
their homes, but the Parsons and the Winships
decided to seek the protection of the fort.</p>

<p>The attack came on the 15th of April, 1777.
The Indians were about a hundred strong, and the
garrison at that time numbered less than fifty,—some
writers state less than forty,—for many of
the settlers were away on a hunting tour.</p>

<p>The first assault of the red men was a fierce one.
A shower of arrows were sent against and over
the stockade that did no damage, and then the
warriors came forward, uttering their shrill war-whoops,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span> 
and flourishing their tomahawks and
hunting knives.</p>

<p>“Here they come!” cried half a dozen of the
settlers who were at the loopholes.</p>

<p>“Stand firm!” was the command. “Don’t fire
until you are sure of your man!”</p>

<p>On came the red men, shouting and dancing,
and another flight of arrows came over the stockade.
Then the pioneers opened fire, and down
went three Indians, two killed instantly.</p>

<p>After that the smoke and din of battle were terrific.
The Indians ran from one end of the stockade
to the other, trying to climb the barrier or
break it down. A log was brought and used as
a battering-ram against the heavy gates. But they
were securely barred on the inside, and before
those at the log could use the ram more than once
two of them were laid low, and then the others
dropped the log and ran for shelter.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! they are on the run!” was the cry,
and the settlers reloaded their guns with all possible
speed.</p>

<p>But the Indians were not yet defeated. Soon
they came forward again, and this attack lasted
quarter of an hour. A good number of stones
were hurled into the fort, and one hit Joe on the
shoulder, causing him to cry out from pain.</p>

<p>“What is it?” came quickly from Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“A stone hit me. Oh!” And Joe dropped his
gun and rubbed the hurt. Fortunately no bones
were broken, and he soon picked up his weapon
and went to his loophole again.</p>

<p>The temper of the settlers was now thoroughly
aroused, and they met the second onslaught of the
Indians with vigor. There was a constant rattle
of musketry, and soon the red men grew disheartened
and retreated once more. Then the
pioneers opened the gates and made after their
foe, and the Indians ran helter-skelter in all directions,
taking their dead and dying with them.</p>

<p>It is a most remarkable fact that in this battle
but one pioneer lost his life, and only two or three
were seriously wounded. How many the Indians
lost will never be known, for, as stated before,
they took all their dead and dying with them. A
fair estimate, however, places their dead at not
less than twenty.</p>

<p>As night was coming on, it was not deemed advisable
to let the settlers return to their homes, so
the families remained in the fort until the next
day. During the night a rainstorm came up, and
in the morning the downpour was heavy. But by
noon the clouds drifted westward and soon the
sun shone as brightly as ever.</p>

<p>The storm was a blessing to many a settler, for
it prevented his cabin from being burnt down by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
the Indians, who ran around from place to place,
with big torches, doing all the damage they could.</p>

<p>After the contest was over, Joe uncovered his
shoulder and found it considerably bruised. Mrs.
Parsons dressed it, and though it hurt for several
days afterward, no serious results followed.</p>

<p>“I reckon I can be thankful that I wasn’t
touched,” said Harry. “An arrow passed right
alongside of my left ear—but a miss is as good
as a mile.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wager a pound that the redskins come
back before long,” said Joe. “They are bound
to wipe this settlement out if they possibly can.”</p>

<p>It was decided that Joe and Harry should return
home first, leaving Mrs. Parsons and the
girls at the fort until the morning following.</p>

<p>“There is no telling in what condition the Indians
have left the cabin,” said Joe. “For all we
know it may be burnt to the ground.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” answered his chum. “Although
I saw no fire in that direction, did you?”</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, I didn’t look—my shoulder
pained me so much.”</p>

<p>The boys were soon on the way, going part of
the distance with some other settlers. The heavy
rains had left the trail ankle deep with mud, so
their progress was somewhat slow. At last, however,
they came in sight of the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>“Hurrah! it is still standing!” cried Harry.
“That is something to be thankful for.”</p>

<p>“But they tried to burn it down, Harry. See,
here is a mass of half-burnt brushwood heaped up
against the north side. If it hadn’t been for the
storm our cabin would now be in ashes.”</p>

<p>“They have burst in the back door, Joe!” was
the next cry. “And see, the living room is about
empty.”</p>

<p>Both ran into the cabin and gazed around them
in dismay. One glance told the truth. The
cabin had been looted from end to end, and all
the small articles of value, including all of their
cooking utensils, had been taken away.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>SHOT ON THE ROOF</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> rascals!”</p>

<p>Such were Joe’s words, as he gazed around the
looted cabin. Yes, every small article of value
was gone, including the knives and spoons, the
trinkets belonging to the girls, and Mrs. Parsons’
sewing outfit.</p>

<p>“Even the fishing poles are gone—and those
new hooks I got last week,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“They took that old Dutch pistol, too,” added
Joe. “I hope it bursts to pieces the first time
they try to use it,” he went on bitterly.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they found the money?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We can soon see.”</p>

<p>Between them Mr. Winship and Mr. Parsons
had had about thirty pounds—a hundred and fifty
dollars—in cash. Before leaving to hunt up the
Indians they had placed this money in an earthen
jar and secreted it under the flooring of one of the
bedrooms. Without delay the boys ran into the
bedroom and pulled up the puncheon log under
which the jar had been hidden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“It is gone!” came from Joe’s lips.</p>

<p>“Gone?” groaned his chum. “Are you certain?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am. Here is the very spot where
the jar rested in the ground.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps my mother took up the jar before she
left the cabin.”</p>

<p>“Did she say anything about it to you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then I reckon your mother didn’t touch it.
But I would like to be sure.”</p>

<p>They hunted around the cabin, but could see
nothing of the jar. Then they visited the loft of
the home. This had also been robbed of the few
articles of value that it had contained.</p>

<p>“They came pretty close to making a clean
sweep of it,” remarked Joe disconsolately.</p>

<p>“They are bound to make us give up living
here, Joe.”</p>

<p>“It looks like it, Harry, but”—Joe drew a
deep breath—“they shan’t scare me away—at
least, not as long as anybody else is willing to
remain in Boonesborough.”</p>

<p>“I say the same.”</p>

<p>A little later they returned to the fort and
acquainted Mrs. Parsons and the girls with the
conditions of affairs.</p>

<p>“I feared as much,” said Mrs. Parsons, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
shake of her head. “’Tis truly awful. But,
Harry, art thee sure the jar is missing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother.”</p>

<p>“I touched it not, my son. If thee has not seen
it, then the Indians stole it.”</p>

<p>“And all the cooking things gone!” put in
Harmony. “However are we going to cook?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to do as we do when we are on a
hunting tour,” said Harry. “I believe they left
one old iron pot—the one with the broken side.”</p>

<p>“It’s enough to wish you were back in the
East again,” said Cora. She was more hurt over
the loss of a brooch than over anything else.
This had been given to her by her grandmother,
and was considered valuable.</p>

<p>There was nothing left to do, however, but to
go back to the cabin, and this they did, and all
hands searched around to find such things as were
absolutely necessary. Then Harry and Joe paid
a visit to two neighbors who had not been robbed,
and borrowed several pots and kettles, and a few
knives and spoons, and also several towels.</p>

<p>“It is as bad as beginning all over again,” said
Mrs. Parsons. “But let us thank God that our
lives have been spared,” she added reverently.</p>

<p>Not long after this attack on the fort at Boonesborough,
Colonel Boone called the settlers together
for a “war talk,” as it was called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“The Indians mean to do their best to wipe us
out,” said Boone. “I feel certain that before a
great while they will attack us again, and with increased
numbers. Now, I want to know what
you wish to do. If you want to retreat, there is
yet time to do so. If you want to stay, we must
set to work to strengthen the fort.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, and then an old
pioneer with white locks and beard arose.</p>

<p>“Colonel Boone, ye listen to me,” he said,
clearly and almost harshly. “I kem out hyer to
settle, an’ I hev settled, an’ no Injuns is gwine
ter unsettle me, onless they kill me fust. Ye kin
go back if ye want to, but ole Bob Chassey
stays hyer.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Bob Chassey!” cried several.</p>

<p>“That’s the talk,” said another pioneer.
“Talk about going back! Whar are we a-going
back to? I aint got no place to go to. I sold
out, clean and clear. I’m a-going to stay here.”</p>

<p>“So am I! So am I!” was heard on every
side.</p>

<p>“If the Injuns want to fight, let’s fight ’em,”
said another.</p>

<p>These various speeches made Daniel Boone
smile broadly. “I see you are of one heart,” he
said. “And I am with you. We’ll stick and
fight it out, if it takes years to do it. I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
if we give the Indians one good sound licking
when they come again, they will leave us alone
for a good long spell.”</p>

<p>The very next day men were set to work to
strengthen and extend the stockade of the fort,
which now took in not only the defense proper,
but also a number of cabins close by. Each man
and boy had to work two days per week on the
fort, and some worked more, so anxious were
they to have all in readiness should another attack
come in the near future.</p>

<p>For the stockade of the fort a goodly number
of small trees were needed. All those in the immediate
vicinity of the stronghold had been cut
down, so the pioneers had to go up and down the
river for more logs. Trees growing close to the
water’s edge would be cut, and a number would
be formed into a raft, to be floated or poled to
the spot desired.</p>

<p>One day in the middle of the week found Joe,
Harry, and Darry Ford hard at work up the river.
They had already brought down six trees of fair
size, and were at work on three more. When
these were down they intended to build a rude
raft of the nine logs, and float them to a spot
Colonel Boone had mentioned to them.</p>

<p>Not far from where the three pioneers were
working was the log cabin of Andrew Pembly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
Here the pioneer resided with his wife and six
small children. The trees that were being cut
were on Pembly’s land, but he was perfectly willing
to have them taken away for purposes of defense.</p>

<p>Pembly was not at home, but his wife and children
were, and several of the little ones came
down to the river front to see the boys at work.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you ought to be down here,”
said Joe to a little girl of six, Mary by name.</p>

<p>“Why can’t I be here?” questioned Mary
innocently.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is quite safe. There may be
Indians around watching us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not afraid,” was the ready reply.</p>

<p>“But you ought to be. Better run up to the
house where your mamma is.”</p>

<p>“No, I am going to stay here,” answered the
little girl, tossing her yellow curls. “If the bad
Indians come you can shoot them all down with
your big gun.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that isn’t cool!” exclaimed Harry,
with a laugh. “Joe, she has cut out a neat bit
of work for you.”</p>

<p>“And it’s such an easy thing to do, too,” put
in Darry Ford. “Of course, the Indians will all
stand up in a row for you, so that you won’t
have any trouble in knocking them over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“If I had a gun I could shoot an Indian,”
went on little Mary. “Let me have your gun,
and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t you touch the gun,” answered
Joe hastily.</p>

<p>Presently the little children began to pick up
the chips of wood. These they carried to the
stream, and tossed them in to see them float away.</p>

<p>“That’s a waste of good chips,” said Harry.
Then he continued to one of the little boys: “Here,
Freddy, you go to the house, and get a basket for
those chips. Your mother will want them for
the fire.”</p>

<p>At once Freddy started off, and all of the others
but little Mary went with him. The little girl
continued to throw chips into the stream, a proceeding
that seemed to interest her very much.</p>

<p>The three trees were now almost down, and
the young pioneers worked with a will to complete
their day’s labor in the forest. Harry’s tree came
down first, and Darry’s was quick to follow. Joe
had five minutes more of work, and went at it
with renewed energy.</p>

<p>Just as the third tree came down a scream from
the river bank startled all three of the boys.</p>

<p>“It’s Mary Pembly!” cried Darry.</p>

<p>Darry was right; the scream had come from
the little girl. She had ventured too close to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
water, her feet had slipped, and down she had
gone, over her head.</p>

<p>The current was swift, and by the time the boys
reached the water-front the little girl was fully
fifty feet away. She had come to the surface, and
was spluttering and crying wildly.</p>

<p>“Take me out!” she cried. “I don’t like the
nasty water!”</p>

<p>“She’ll be drowned!” ejaculated Darry.</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it!” came from Harry.</p>

<p>He flung off his jacket and shoes, and without
hesitation ran down the river bank a hundred feet
or more. Then he plunged in and began to swim
toward the little girl with all the strength at his
command.</p>

<p>Ordinarily Harry was a good swimmer, but
the chopping down of three trees had tired him,
and by the time he gained the middle of the river
Mary Pembly had floated past the spot. Panting
somewhat for breath, Harry made after her.</p>

<p>She was going down again, when he caught
hold of her arm, and drew her toward him.</p>

<p>“Oh, help me, please!” she spluttered, and
then caught him around the neck in a tight embrace.</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t hold me so tight!” he gasped.
“I’ll—I’ll save you.”</p>

<p>But he could not reason with her, and in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
fright she only clung tighter than ever, until he
was nearly strangled.</p>

<p>“Harry is having his hands full,” cried Joe, as
he ran along the river bank watching the scene.</p>

<p>“If he isn’t careful, they’ll both go down,” put
in Darry.</p>

<p>“I’m going to run ahead to the bend, Darry.
Perhaps I can give him a lift there.”</p>

<p>The bend was two hundred feet further down
the river, and Joe sped to the spot with all
speed.</p>

<p>Here there was a low-bending tree, with
branches spreading far over the watercourse.</p>

<p>Without hesitation the young pioneer leaped
into the tree, and made his way out on the
branches, that hung but a couple of yards above
the surface of the river.</p>

<p>At first, owing to the thick growth in that vicinity,
he could see little or nothing.</p>

<p>“Harry, where are you?” he called.</p>

<p>“Help, Joe, help!” was the answer. “She is
dragging me down!”</p>

<p>With these words Harry and his burden came
into view. Little Mary clung as tight as ever, and
it was next to impossible for Harry to do any
swimming. He was treading water, but had gone
down over his head twice.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer swept the pair in the stream,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
and bending low Joe managed at last to catch little
Mary by the arm.</p>

<p>“Come up here,” he said. “I will save
you.”</p>

<p>She hardly understood the words, so great was
her terror. But she saw the tree and Joe, and,
letting go her hold of Harry, clutched both in a
death-like grip. Then Joe caught her tight and
soon carried her to the shore.</p>

<p>“My, but that was more than I bargained
for!” gasped Harry, when he managed to crawl
from the stream.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the river at all,” came from little
Mary. Then she looked at her wet and muddy
frock. “Oh, my beautiful dress! What will
mamma say?”</p>

<p>“Never mind the dress,” answered Joe.</p>

<p>He took her to the log cabin, and Harry followed.
One of the children had just brought in
word that Mary had fallen into the river, and
Mrs. Pembly was highly excited.</p>

<p>“My child! my child!” she exclaimed. “Is
she safe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s all right,” answered Joe. “Harry
saved her.”</p>

<p>“Joe had something to do with it,” put in
Harry.</p>

<p>The story was soon told, and Mrs. Pembly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
thanked them over and over again for their services.</p>

<p>“I have warned Mary not to go near the
river,” said she. “She was a naughty girl to
go.”</p>

<p>“Mary will never, never go there again,” said
the child. “The river is all muddy and wet—it
aint a nice river at all!”</p>

<p>Harry was given a shift of clothing belonging
to Andrew Pembly, and this he put on while his
own were drying at the fire. Fortunately
neither the youth nor the little girl suffered from
the wetting received.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget your kindness,” said
Mrs. Pembly. And she never did.</p>

<p>It was no easy work to bring the nine logs
together and float them down to the fort, and
it was after dark when the task was finally accomplished.</p>

<p>The news of the rescue had preceded them,
and Harry was hailed as a hero, something that
made him blush a good deal.</p>

<p>“I reckon I only did my duty,” he said. “It
wasn’t much either. I could have gotten to
shore easily if she hadn’t caught me by the neck
and cut off my wind.”</p>

<p>“You’re a hero right enough,” said Darry.
“And Joe deserves some credit, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>The time for planting was once again at hand,
and Joe and Harry worked early and late, and
always with their weapons where they could lay
hands upon the guns at the first intimation of
danger. How little do boys of to-day realize
the perils and hardships of the years gone by!</p>

<p>In the cabin Mrs. Parsons and the girls were
equally busy. All arose at four o’clock in the
morning, and it was rarely that anybody turned
in to sleep before nine or ten in the evening. In
those days there were no such things as amusements,
for the dread of another attack by the Indians
was on every mind. Every Sunday a service
was held at the fort by a traveling preacher, who
had come there some months before, and this service
was the only gathering Mrs. Parsons and the
girls attended.</p>

<p>On the Fourth of July—just one year after the
Declaration of Independence had been declared—Joe
and Harry were hard at work in the field,
when a horseman, his steed covered with foam,
dashed up to the cabin.</p>

<p>“The Indians are coming!” he shouted. “To
the fort with all speed!” And then, having made
sure that his message was heard, he rode off as
rapidly as he had come.</p>

<p>“The Indians! The Indians!” shouted one and
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>It had been decided long before what should be
done in case of such a warning, so there was little
confusion. Mrs. Parsons had a large cloth handy,
and into this she and the girls dumped such things
as they wished to take along. In the meantime
the boys came running up, obtained all their available
weapons, and then shut up and otherwise
secured the cabin.</p>

<p>Inside of ten minutes all were on their way to
the fort. They were soon joined by several neighbors,
and from one of these learned that Colonel
Boone had discovered that the red men were
marching on Boonesborough, not less than two
hundred strong.</p>

<p>“And they are sending other bands of Indians
to the other settlements,” went on the pioneer.</p>

<p>“That is too bad,” answered Joe. “For in
that case we can’t look for outside help.”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a fight to a finish, this time,
Joe.”</p>

<p>When they arrived at the fort they found but
a handful of hunters and pioneers present. Many
men were off a great distance, and although they
were notified, they did not come in until several
days later. All told, there were exactly twenty-two
men on hand, and nine youths over the age of
twelve.</p>

<p>Soon the outposts announced that the Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
were less than a mile away, and coming toward
the fort as fast as they could travel. Colonel
Boone immediately assembled his force and gave
each man and youth his station, and also told the
women and girls what they might do if called on
for assistance. Every part of the fort and
grounds was wet down, so that there might be
no danger of fire.</p>

<p>The first shock of the attack was not long in
coming. Relying upon their superior force, the
Indians advanced boldly, sending a flight of
arrows against and over the stockade, and also
firing off the few muskets they possessed. Their
yells and war-whoops were deafening, and the
pioneers answered with a ringing shout of defiance.</p>

<p>Boone’s men had been cautioned, time and
again, to save their powder and bullets, and not
one fired until he could make sure of his aim.
As the Indians hurled themselves against the
stockade the rifles of the pioneers spoke up and
fully a dozen red men were either killed or
wounded.</p>

<p>After this first savage assault, the red men retired
to the shelter of the forest, and for half an
hour nothing was seen or heard of them.</p>

<p>“They are up to some new trick,” said Joe.
“The Indian is at his worst when he is quiet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>Several sharpshooters were in the trees inside
the stockade and they now announced that the
red men had built several camp-fires at a distance.</p>

<p>Then came another shout from the forest, and
fully thirty Indians appeared. Each had a
flaming arrow fixed to his bow, and this he let
drive over the stockade among the various buildings
within.</p>

<p>“They are going to try to burn us out!” called
out a number of the pioneers.</p>

<p>“Put out the fires!” ordered Daniel Boone, and
he himself went around stamping out one arrow
after another. The women appeared with buckets
of water and wet swabs, and soon every arrow
but one was extinguished. This arrow was on
a sloping roof and burned fiercely.</p>

<p>“I reckon I can get that,” called out Harry,
and, throwing down his musket, he started to
climb to the top of the building.</p>

<p>“Have a care there!” called out Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>“I’m on the watch,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>It was no mean task to reach the roof of the
log building, and once there Harry had a hard
task of it to put out the flames, which were spreading
in spite of the wetting the building had received.</p>

<p>“Here is a wet cloth,” called out Joe, and
threw the object up to his chum.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>Harry caught the cloth and was just on the
point of pounding out some more of the fire with
it, when another flight of arrows came into the inclosure.</p>

<p>One arrow struck the young pioneer in the leg,
and another in the arm.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he cried. “I am struck!”</p>

<p>“Harry! Harry! come down!” called out Joe.</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when Harry pitched
headlong on the roof of the building. Then he
rolled over and over down to the edge and
dropped a dead weight into Joe’s arms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>THE RETREAT OF THE INDIANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, Mrs. Parsons, Harry is killed!”</p>

<p>It was Harmony who uttered the cry, for she
had seen Harry go down with the two arrows
sticking into him.</p>

<p>“My son killed!” screamed Mrs. Parsons,
rushing forward to where she could catch sight of
the form in Joe’s arms. “Oh, Harry! Harry!
is it true that the Indians have slain thee?” she
wailed.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he is dead,” said Joe, his own
face white and drawn. “He is struck in the
leg and the arm.”</p>

<p>“Bring him to yonder cabin,” said the distracted
mother, and Joe did as directed. Blood
was flowing freely from Harry’s wounds and it
was seen that he had fainted from the shock and
from weakness.</p>

<p>“If those arrows are poisoned he will surely
die,” came from Cora.</p>

<p>“They are not poisoned,” said Daniel Boone,
who had walked up and who examined the shafts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
closely. “Bind up his wounds with care, and I
warrant he will pull through.”</p>

<p>At once Mrs. Parsons and the girls did all they
could for the sufferer. In the meantime other
flaming arrows were coming into the inclosure,
and Joe had to rush away once more, to do his
full share in extinguishing the fires that sprang
up.</p>

<p>Luckily the pioneers had a never-failing supply
of water direct from the river on which the fort
was located, so in spite of the flaming arrows they
managed to keep the various conflagrations under
control. Seeing this, the Indians withdrew once
more, to consider another plan for defeating the
hated palefaces.</p>

<p>It was now sometime after noon and all were
hungry. A hasty meal was prepared, and as
hastily eaten, and the men continued on guard.
As all remained quiet, Joe stole to the cabin, to
see how Harry was faring.</p>

<p>“I—I’m not yet dead,” the sufferer managed to
say. “But I reckon I am out of th—this fight.”</p>

<p>“I am so thankful he was not killed,” said
Mrs. Parsons. “But oh, if this cruel fighting was
only at an end!” And she covered her face with
her apron.</p>

<p>Slowly the afternoon dragged by and not a
single sign of an Indian was seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“Goin’ to wait until night,” said Pep Frost
“Injuns allers like to fight after dark. Reckon
we’ll have an all-fired hot time atween now an’
sun-up to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, we must take what comes,” answered
Joe. His own heart felt like a lump of lead in
his bosom. With his father and his mother missing,
and also Mr. Parsons and Clara, and with
Harry seriously wounded, the future looked black
indeed.</p>

<p>“If the Indians manage to get in here it will
be all up with us,” he reasoned.</p>

<p>Pep Frost was right, the Indians were waiting
for nightfall, and hardly had darkness come
over the fort, than the attack was renewed with
vigor. Arrows flew in all directions, and more
than one tomahawk came whizzing over the
stockade and close to some pioneer’s head. As
in the daytime the yells of the red men were
frightful.</p>

<p>Joe and Pep Frost had been stationed at a certain
angle of the fort. Just beyond was a high
rock, and half a dozen of the enemy were secreted
behind this. Two had muskets, and they
fired whenever they caught the least sign of anybody
in the stronghold.</p>

<p>“We must try to plug them Injuns,” said
Frost. “Joey, you keep yer eye glued on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
right o’ the rocks an’ I’ll watch the left. Shoot
the fust rascal ez shows himself.”</p>

<p>Joe did as he was bidden, and stood at the
loophole with his hand ready on the trigger of
his rifle.</p>

<p>Suddenly an Indian bobbed up, bow and arrow
in hand. He let drive directly for the loophole,
and the arrow hit the edge of Joe’s rifle barrel.
At the same time the youth pulled the trigger of
the weapon.</p>

<p>Joe’s aim was true, and the Indian fell with a
serious bullet wound close to his ear. Then Pep
Frost’s rifle also cracked, and a second Indian fell,
shot through the throat.</p>

<p>“Thet’s the time we cotched ’em,” chuckled
the old frontiersman. “They can’t play any o’
their funny games around here, ha! ha!”</p>

<p>Again the Indians found their assault on the
fort unsuccessful, and again they retreated. Long
Knife was at their head, and some of the warriors
complained bitterly to him of their want of
success.</p>

<p>“Long Knife said the fort would be taken
with ease,” said one warrior. “But we have not
captured it, and thirteen of our braves are already
slain.”</p>

<p>“We have approached too openly,” said Long
Knife. “We must come up as panthers in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
dark. We will rest and throw them off the
watch.”</p>

<p>No other attack was made until nearly four
o’clock in the morning. Then half of the Indians
entered their canoes and put out on the water.
Their idea was to paddle to that part of the fort
which rested on the river bank, and then try crawling
through the ditch that let the water into the
stockade.</p>

<p>But the pioneers were on the watch, and no
sooner had the swarm of canoes appeared than
several of the warriors were shot down. Two
of the craft were sunk, and the occupants had a
lively time of it swimming for their lives.</p>

<p>Two canoes reached the ditch, and five Indians
dived down under the stockade. When they attempted
to come up on the inside they were
stopped by a row of long stakes that Daniel Boone
had had planted there the day previous. Not
wishing to be drowned like rats in a trap, the Indians
had to retreat; and then the whole body left
the river, not to return.</p>

<p>“Whoopee!” shouted Pep Frost, throwing
up his cap in his delight. “Put down another
failure fer ’em! It’s a pity they didn’t come in,
so ez we could have killed ’em off one at a
time!”</p>

<p>When the sun rose it found the pioneers still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
on guard. All were much worn by what they had
passed through, yet nobody felt like lying down
to sleep. Strong coffee and hearty rations were
served, and Boone divided his force into two
parties, one to remain on guard, and the other
to take it easy until another alarm should sound
out.</p>

<p>So far there had been but one man killed and
two wounded, including Harry. The wounded
youth lay resting quietly, and Mrs. Parsons was
close by, ready to minister to his wants so far as
her limited means permitted.</p>

<p>Slowly the hot July day passed. In the stockade
it was almost suffocating, and one girl fainted
from the heat. But water was plentiful and cool,
and nobody complained.</p>

<p>It was not until the middle of the afternoon
that the Indians massed their forces for a final
assault. On they came yelling and whooping like
demons, and again the arrows flew all around and
in the stockade. Large stones were also hurled at
the fort, and more than a score of the red men
climbed into the nearby trees, and tried to pick
off the whites from these points of vantage.</p>

<p>The red men in the trees could hardly be seen,
and to make sure of them Daniel Boone had half
a dozen muskets heavily loaded with buckshot.</p>

<p>In the old-fashioned bores of that period this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
shot scattered itself over a wide space, and the
Indians came down from the trees in a hurry,
some literally “peppered” to death, and all more
or less wounded.</p>

<p>“Gosh! but this beats bird huntin’,” observed
Pep Frost. “See ’em tumble. Whoop! but it’s
jest the thing!” And he let drive another dose
of the shot.</p>

<p>Down at the east end of the fort the fight was
more desperate than it had been for the whole
two days. Six or seven of the red men succeeded
in climbing the stockade, and a fierce hand-to-hand
struggle ensued, in which four were thrown
down and mortally wounded. The other two ran
toward the heavy gate, with the idea of throwing
off the bars and opening the barrier.</p>

<p>“No you don’t!” cried Daniel Boone, and
with a few leaps he was on the red men. Each
threw a tomahawk at the old hunter. But he
dodged the weapons, and sent one Indian to the
earth by a blow from his gun-stock. Then he
grappled with the other fellow, and both rolled on
the ground.</p>

<p>“Boone is down!” cried a woman, and, turning,
Joe saw the struggle that was taking place.
He ran for the spot with all speed, and just as the
Indian was trying to stab Daniel Boone with his
hunting knife the youth kicked out and struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
the enemy in the head, completely stunning him.
Then Boone arose, and another blow put the red
man out of the fight forever.</p>

<p>The fall of the six men who had mounted the
stockade, and of those who had climbed the trees,
was a great blow to the Indians, and soon one of
the old warriors sounded the retreat. This command
made Long Knife furious, for he wanted
to continue fighting, but nobody would listen to
him, and at last the Indians retreated, and the
enraged chief followed. It may be added that in
the forest the chief tried to argue the point with
the old warrior, who, instead of talking, struck
Long Knife in the mouth, and told him to be
quiet.</p>

<p>“Black Wolf is right,” said another warrior.
“Long Knife would lead us to death. We have
had enough of fighting the white man in his
strong box. Henceforth Arrowhead shall fight
the white man only in the forest.”</p>

<p>From the manner in which the Indians left the
vicinity of the fort Daniel Boone was satisfied that
they had almost enough of the fighting.</p>

<p>“Had we a few more men, we could follow
them and bring them to terms,” he said. “But
as it is we will have to continue on guard until
we are certain they have left this locality.”</p>

<p>Three days were spent in the fort, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
some settlers from another locality arrived. They
brought news that four other points had been attacked,
but in each contest the enemy had been
driven off with a heavy loss.</p>

<p>“Long Knife has encamped up at Flat-Rock
Run,” said the pioneer. “A good many of his
followers have deserted him. We are going up
there after him. If we can capture him perhaps
we can then learn what has become of the women
and children he made captives a long while ago.”</p>

<p>“Let me go with you!” cried Joe eagerly.</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes! yes! My mother was made a prisoner,
and one of my girl friends, Clara Parsons, is missing,
too.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” put in Pep Frost. “Joey can go
with me.”</p>

<p>Six others volunteered for the expedition. The
other pioneers, by Daniel Boone’s advice, remained
at the fort, to defend that stronghold.</p>

<p>The distance to Flat-Rock Run was not over
eighteen miles, but the trail was exceeding rough,
and progress was necessarily slow.</p>

<p>“Long Knife knows what he is doing,” said
Pep Frost, as he and Joe trudged along side by
side. “If he can’t fight he’ll hide in the hills,
an’ we won’t have no fool o’ a task routin’ him out
nuther!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>“We can stick to his trail until we catch him,”
answered the young pioneer simply. “I don’t
care how much I suffer, so long as I learn what
has become of my mother and father and the rest.”</p>

<p>“Spoken jest like a good boy, Joey. Wall,
I’m with ye to the finish, ye kin jest wager yer
last shillin’ on that!”</p>

<p>That night the pioneers and hunters went into
camp in something of a hollow. A strict guard
was kept, and before sunrise the march forward
was resumed. Two hours later a sharpshooter
who had been in advance came back with the news
that the band under Long Knife was in sight,
camping at the edge of a small stream running
through the hills.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>THE LONG-LOST AT LAST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> once there was great excitement among the
men who had thus followed Long Knife and his
warriors to their newly made camp. Every
pioneer and old hunter felt that a crisis was at
hand.</p>

<p>“I think we have the redskins at a disadvantage,”
said one old hunter. “We ought to teach
them a lesson they will never forget.”</p>

<p>“Have they any captives with them?” questioned
Joe.</p>

<p>This question could not be answered, for part
of the Indians’ camp was concealed by a dense
mass of brushwood.</p>

<p>The old hunters now resorted to strategy. The
party was divided into three parts, which were to
station themselves around the Indian encampment
at equal distances. At a given signal two of the
parties were to rush forward, and open on the
red men. This would most likely drive the warriors
under Long Knife to the shelter of another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
part of the forest, and here the third party was
to open fire when they had the Indians at close
range.</p>

<p>The hunters and pioneers moved to their stations
without the slightest noise. Each man carried
not only his rifle, but also a pistol and a long
hunting knife.</p>

<p>Joe’s heart was thumping wildly, for he knew
that this was to be the most dangerous battle in
which he had so far taken part. But his teeth
were firmly set.</p>

<p>“I’ll do my duty if I die for it,” was what he
told himself—not once, but many times.</p>

<p>At last all was in readiness for the attack. The
signal was given, and the whites of the two parties
swept in closer still, and then opened fire.</p>

<p>At the first volley three Indians fell, one killed
and the others mortally wounded. Then a fierce
war-whoop sounded, and the braves caught up
their own weapons.</p>

<p>The whites had calculated well, and, as they
expected, the red men did their best to gain the
forest ahead of them. As they came on, the third
party of hunters met them, and in this onslaught
six Indians fell to rise no more.</p>

<p>All of the guns and pistols had now been discharged,
and a thick smoke filled the vicinity. In
the midst of this, whites and Indians leaped at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
each other in a hand-to-hand encounter that was
bloody in the extreme. Blood flowed freely, and
Joe saw two old pioneers scalped before his eyes.</p>

<p>At the first shock of battle the young pioneer
was stunned. But soon his presence of mind returned
to him, and he became unusually cool and
collected. He discharged his pistol almost in the
face of one brawny Indian, and then engaged another
with his hunting knife.</p>

<p>It was a sharp struggle, and as the pair grappled,
the Indian slipped and dragged Joe down
with him. Over and over they rolled, and the red
man at last succeeded in wounding Joe in the
shoulder. But the youth was game and struck
out wildly, and by a lucky stroke caught his opponent
in the ribs. Then, as another white came
running up, the Indian arose and staggered off.
Joe also tried to get up, but a foot suddenly struck
him a heavy blow back of the ear, and he fell on
his face, unconscious.</p>

<p>The tide of war was now shifting to another
part of the forest, and for the time being the young
pioneer lay where he had fallen with nobody
coming to disturb him. The fighting was as
fierce as ever, but was gradually lost in the distance.</p>

<p>At last Joe stirred and opened his eyes in a
dazed, uncertain way. Then, thinking his enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
still at hand, he threw up one arm, as if to defend
himself.</p>

<p>“Fight fair,” he murmured, and soon sat up,
staring around him.</p>

<p>He was much surprised to find himself alone.
The blood was flowing from the wound he had
received, but fortunately the hurt was not severe.</p>

<p>He remembered that there had been a stream
at hand, and he crawled rather than walked to
this, to bathe his wound and get a drink of water.</p>

<p>“I must have been completely knocked out,”
was his thought. “I wonder what became of that
Indian?”</p>

<p>After bathing and drinking his fill, he sat down
by the edge of the stream to collect his scattered
senses. He could not tell how long it was since
he had been fighting.</p>

<p>“Must be an hour or two at least,” he told himself.
“Anyway, everybody seems to have cleared
out, and left me to myself. I wonder if we
whipped them?”</p>

<p>Joe was sitting on the river bank, when presently
something up the stream attracted his attention.
It was a canoe coming around a bend, and
the craft contained two Indians.</p>

<p>“Hullo, I’ll have to get out of sight,” he muttered,
and started to move back, when he received
a push that sent him headlong into the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>By the time he came to the surface, the canoe
was drawing close. Looking on the river bank he
saw three Indians standing there, each armed with
a rifle and a tomahawk. One of the red men was
Long Knife.</p>

<p>“White boy is a prisoner,” cried the Indian
chief, his eyes gleaming wickedly. “If try to
run Long Knife will tomahawk him.”</p>

<p>There was no help for it, and Joe walked out
of the river, and submitted to having his hands
tied behind him. Then he was ordered into the
canoe, which was a large craft, and Long Knife
and the others followed.</p>

<p>The course of the canoe was along the stream,
which was not over fifteen feet in width, and very
winding. The primeval forest arose on both sides,
and in many places the branches of the trees interlaced,
making the surface of the watercourse dark
and cool.</p>

<p>Joe had no idea where he was being taken,
and the Indians would answer no questions. Long
Knife and his followers seemed unusually silent
and bitter, and from this the young pioneer came
to the conclusion that the battle had gone against
them, and with heavy loss.</p>

<p>“If that’s the case they won’t have much mercy
on me,” he reasoned.</p>

<p>The canoe kept on its way for many miles and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
then took to another watercourse, which was
twice as wide as the first. The Indians were now
approaching one of their regular villages, and
they passed along in absolute silence, doubtless
thinking that the whites might be there awaiting
their coming.</p>

<p>But none of the hunters who had gone forth to
fight them were in the vicinity, and soon an old
Indian met them and told them that all so far
was safe.</p>

<p>“It is well,” said Long Knife gruffly. Then
he ordered the canoe brought around to another
bend, and here the party went ashore, taking Joe
with them.</p>

<p>The village was rather a straggling one, extending
from the river to a spring far up among
the rocks. Here the Indians had erected a rude
stockade and inside were half a dozen prisoners.</p>

<p>“You shall remain there until another sun,”
said Long Knife. “And let not the white boy
try to escape,” he added. “Long Knife knows
how to torture those who will not obey him.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you are bloodthirsty enough for
anything,” muttered Joe in return.</p>

<p>He entered the rude stockade with downcast
heart, but hardly was he within than he gave a
sudden shout of half wonder and half joy:</p>

<p>“Mother!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>“Joe! my Joe!” was the answer, and in a moment
more mother and son were in each other’s
arms.</p>

<p>It was indeed Mrs. Winship, but so thin and
careworn that none but one closely connected
with her would have recognized the lady. With
Mrs. Winship was Clara Parsons, who was also
amazed to see the lad she knew so well.</p>

<p>“How came you here?” asked Mrs. Winship,
after their greeting was over.</p>

<p>“It’s a long story, mother,” Joe answered, and
then he told her of the fight and of his capture,
and then of life in Boonesborough and at the fort,
and of how the others were faring.</p>

<p>“We have had many ups and downs since we
were captured,” said Mrs. Winship. “Our adventures
would fill a book. We escaped twice,
and three times your father and others tried to
rescue us. But it has all been of no avail, and
here we are still, and likely to remain, I suppose.”
And the good woman heaved a long sigh.</p>

<p>“Well, so long as we are alive let us hope for
the best,” answered Joe, as cheerfully as he could.
“Of one thing I am sure. The Indians were
defeated in that last battle, and it may be that our
friends will now take steps to round them all up
and make them give up all their captives.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope that happens!” cried Clara Parsons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
“I am almost crazy to see mother and
Harry and father again—and to see that cabin
you say you have built.”</p>

<p>On the whole Mrs. Winship and Clara had
been treated fairly well. The woman had been
made to work with the squaws, and Long Knife
had urged Clara many times to become his wife.
But the girl had refused him, and this had pleased
Cornball, an old dame who was already the chief’s
spouse.</p>

<p>“Cornball wants me to keep on refusing him,”
said Clara. “She says that as long as I do so
she will protect both me and your mother. She
doesn’t care much for Long Knife, but she says
he has no right to marry anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Good for the old squaw,” answered Joe. “I
hope she sticks by you until we are all rescued.”</p>

<p>That night a strict guard was kept, not alone
around the village, but also over the prisoners in
the stockade. Long Knife expected an attack
hourly by the whites, but it did not come.</p>

<p>“They have missed the trail,” he said at last
to some of his warriors. “Sleeping Bear has
thrown dust into their eyes.” He referred to a
brave who had gone off with the express purpose
of “working” a blind trail, thus throwing the
whites off the track.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>It was nearly noon of the next day that Long
Knife came in to see Joe. His face was more
sour than ever, for a report had come in that his
loss in the last battle was nearly twice as large as
at first anticipated.</p>

<p>“Does the white boy remember Long Knife?”
he asked abruptly, as he stood before Joe with
folded arms.</p>

<p>“I do,” answered Joe, knowing that nothing
was to be gained by evasion.</p>

<p>“Does the white boy remember when he saw
Long Knife in a canoe with a white maiden?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“The white boy tried his best to kill Long
Knife.”</p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t I?” cried Joe. “The
white maiden was my sister. Long Knife had
no right to carry her off.”</p>

<p>“Long Knife has a right to do as pleases him,”
answered the Indian coldly. “He bows to no
law of the white man.”</p>

<p>To this Joe did not answer.</p>

<p>“The white boy has found his mother here?”
went on the Indian.</p>

<p>“Yes. And you have no right to keep her a
captive either.”</p>

<p>“Bah! The white boy must not talk in that
manner to a chief of the red warriors. Does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
the white boy know why I have brought him
here?”</p>

<p>“To keep me a prisoner, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No; Long Knife wants him not as a prisoner.
Long Knife looks for more than that.
He wants some sport—and he is going to have
it.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with me?”</p>

<p>“Long Knife will give to the white boy’s
mother a sight that will please her eyes. She
shall see her son burnt at the stake.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br>

<small>BACK TO THE CABIN—CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> had often heard of the extreme cruelties
of the Indians, and now he was brought face to
face with what might be expected of such a black-hearted
warrior as Long Knife.</p>

<p>It was not enough that this rascal contemplated
burning the young pioneer at the stake,—the
most cruel death devised by the savages,—but
he also calculated to inflict equal if not deeper
pain on the youth’s mother by making the woman
witness the torture of her offspring.</p>

<p>“Long Knife, you are a—a monster!” cried
the boy, when he could find his tongue.</p>

<p>At these words the eyes of the Indian chief
gleamed with cruel pleasure.</p>

<p>“The white boy is joyful over the news that
Long Knife brings to him,” he remarked dryly.</p>

<p>“If you do this thing you will surely suffer
for it.”</p>

<p>“In what way will Long Knife suffer? The
cries of his enemies is sweet music to his ears.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“Daniel Boone and my other friends will hear
of this and they will, sooner or later, bring you
to justice for it.”</p>

<p>“The whites must conquer the red men first,
and they have not yet done so.”</p>

<p>“They came pretty close to doing it yesterday.”</p>

<p>At this Long Knife could no longer suppress
his anger over the outcome of that contest. Stepping
forward, he hit Joe a savage blow in the
mouth.</p>

<p>“The white boy’s tongue runs too much,” he
said, and strode away out of the stockade.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winship and Clara had not heard this
conversation, so they knew nothing of what was
in store for Joe. Several times he tried to tell
them, but each time the words stuck in his throat.</p>

<p>It was awful to think of suffering such a death,
but Joe had to think of his mother quite as much
as of himself.</p>

<p>“The shock will kill her, too,” he told himself.
“To see me die by inches will set her
crazy.”</p>

<p>At last he managed to call Clara Parsons to
one side and tell her of what Long Knife had
said.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe, will he really be as wicked as that?”
asked the frightened girl, her face growing deadly
pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>“I think he means to keep his word, Clara.”</p>

<p>“But—but—oh, Joe, it is dreadful!” And
she burst into tears.</p>

<p>“I know it, Clara. But if I’ve got to die I’ll
do it as bravely as I can. It’s mother I am thinking
about. You must comfort her all you can.”</p>

<p>“You must tell her at once, Joe. She’ll want
to talk to you before—before——” The girl
could not finish.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell her, Clara—the words won’t
come.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll do it for you,” was the slow answer.</p>

<p>As expected, it was a great shock to Mrs. Winship,
and when she realized the situation fully
she fainted dead away. On recovering she
clasped her son to her breast, refusing to let him
go.</p>

<p>“They shall not separate us,” she cried firmly.</p>

<p>“Mother, perhaps it is all—all for the best,”
said the youth, as bravely as he could. “Everybody
has got to die sometime. Long Knife
wants to make you suffer. I want you to be
brave. He’ll be disappointed if you take it
calmly.”</p>

<p>But the mother only shook her head.</p>

<p>“It is too much, Joe,” she wailed. “You are
my only boy. I’d rather die in your stead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>It was less than an hour after this that an Indian
guard came in and separated Joe from the
other captives. The boy was taken to a wigwam
and there bound hands and feet to a post planted
firmly in the ground.</p>

<p>Slowly the afternoon wore away and nobody
came near the young pioneer. The wigwam was
very close and he was hot and thirsty, yet none
came to give him even a drink of water. Long
Knife was trying to weaken him, so that his torture
at the stake might be so much the greater.</p>

<p>In vain the youth tugged at the thongs that
bound him to the post. The Indians had done
their work well, and although he cut both his
wrists he could not release either hand.</p>

<p>Long Knife had gone off on a scout, but returned
an hour before sunset. Many of his warriors
were angry over the way the battle against
the whites had terminated, but when he announced
that the young paleface was to be burnt at the
stake the young braves set up a howl of pleasure,
and the defeat was forgotten.</p>

<p>It was settled that the burning was to take
place at sunset, and this awful ceremony was preceded
by several incantations by the medicine man
of the village, and then by a fire dance of the
Indians themselves.</p>

<p>While the dance was in progress Mrs. Winship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
and Clara were brought out and their hands were
bound behind them. Four squaws stood close
by, each with a whip in hand, ready to flog either
of the captives should they show any signs of
disobedience.</p>

<p>In the center of a clearing another post was
planted, and presently Joe was led forth from the
wigwam and stood up against this. Then a
rope, soaked in water, was tied around both the
youth and the post, making him a prisoner once
more.</p>

<p>The Indians had a pile of brushwood handy,
and this was speedily shoved up around the captive.
Then Long Knife stepped forward and
faced Joe, his black eyes gleaming more maliciously
than ever.</p>

<p>“The white boy is trying to be brave, but he
is a coward at heart,” began the Indian chief.</p>

<p>To this Joe made no answer.</p>

<p>“Why does not the white boy beg for mercy?”</p>

<p>“What would be the use?” answered Joe.
“Long Knife doesn’t know what mercy means.”</p>

<p>“The white boy is right. Long Knife is
merciless—and Long Knife does not forget.”</p>

<p>So speaking the Indian chief took a torch from
the hands of one of his braves and set fire to the
brushwood.</p>

<p>As the flames began to mount around Joe’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
lower limbs Mrs. Winship let out a scream of
anguish and then fainted in Clara’s arms.</p>

<p>But scarcely had that scream rent the air than
there came a cry of alarm from an Indian guard.
Then followed half a dozen rifle-shots, and with
his torch still in hand Long Knife pitched over
into the burning brushwood, dead!</p>

<p>“The palefaces! The palefaces!” was the
cry. “They have surrounded the village!”</p>

<p>The rifle-cracks increased, and then came a yell
from the throats of fully twoscore of hunters,
and Daniel Boone, Ezra Winship, Peter Parsons,
and some others appeared. Mr. Winship made
straight for the burning brushwood and kicked
it in all directions. Then came several slashes
of his hunting knife, and Joe was free.</p>

<p>“Father!” cried the boy. He could scarcely
believe the evidence of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” answered Ezra Winship. “Here,
take this pistol and defend yourself.”</p>

<p>The fighting on all sides was now fearful, and
hunting knives and tomahawks were freely used.
The whites lost no time in seeing Mrs. Winship
and Clara to a place of safety, and in caring for
the other captives.</p>

<p>For once the red men had been caught napping,
and the battle went against them from the
very start. With Long Knife dead they speedily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
became demoralized, and in less than quarter of
an hour after the first shot was fired they were
fleeing in all directions.</p>

<p>But the blood of the pioneers was now up, and
the chase after the Indians was kept up all of that
night and also the day following. How many
were killed and wounded will never be known,
but it is a fact that from that time forth the bands
that had formerly been headed by Long Knife
and Red Feather became a thing of the past.
Those who were not killed left that vicinity entirely
and their squaws and children went after
them.</p>

<p>Wounded though he was, Joe went with his
father after the Indians, so that he did not return
to his mother’s side until sometime after his rescue
from the flames.</p>

<p>It was a happy reunion and one long remembered,
both by the Winships and the Parsons.
And all of the other captives who had at last escaped
from the clutches of the red men were
equally joyful.</p>

<p>At the Indian village were found the most of
the things stolen from the whites, and these articles
were, later on, returned to their respective
owners.</p>

<p>It was a happy band that returned to Boonesborough
about a week later. Those left at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
fort turned out to meet those who were coming
in, and a celebration was held that lasted far into
the night. Mrs. Parsons was especially glad to
see her daughter alive and well, and Harry was
equally pleased.</p>

<p>“I hope we may never be separated again,”
said Harry, who was doing as well as could be
expected.</p>

<p>“Amen to that,” returned Joe. “And I also
hope that we have had our last fight with the
Indians.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Here let me draw to a close this tale of adventures
while “With Boone on the Frontier.”</p>

<p>The return to the cabin by our friends was the
cause of another celebration. Mrs. Winship was
much pleased by the new homestead, and it was
decided that rather than build another cabin the
old one should be enlarged and the two families
should remain together until times became more
settled.</p>

<p>The fights with the Indians continued for several
months, but there were no engagements of
importance, and in the fall some troops came in
from the East, and then the uprisings became
largely a thing of the past.</p>

<p>It was not long before Harry was able to be
around again, and then the work of enlarging the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
cabin was begun in earnest. In the end the
building was made nearly twice as large as before,
and here the Parsons and the Winships
dwelt for three years. Then Mr. Parsons, aided
by the Winships, built another cabin for himself,
and also started to cultivate an extra stretch of
land.</p>

<p>During those years a warm attachment sprang
up between Harry and Harmony, and one spring
they became man and wife and went to settle on
a farm of their own. A year later Joe was married
to Clara Parsons, and they took a tract a
little further west. At the same time Cora married
Darry Ford, and the pair settled down beside
Joe and Clara. It may be mentioned here that
all were prosperous, and in later years Joe served
in the State Legislature of Kentucky with much
honor. Daniel Boone was especially proud of
him, and often spoke of the young representative
as “one of my boys, and a good one, too!”</p>

<p>The days of peril and privation are now a thing
of the past in Kentucky, and prosperity flourishes
on every hand. Yet it is well at times to look
back and learn something of what the men of
those days endured in order that the present generation
might receive the blessings bestowed upon
them.</p>

<p class="ph2">The Railroad Series</p>
</div>

<p class="ph3">BY ALLEN CHAPMAN.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ralph Fairbanks was bound to become a railroad man, as
his father had been before him. Step by step he worked his
way upward, serving first in the Roundhouse, cleaning locomotives;
then in the Switch Tower, clearing the tracks; then
on the Engine, as a fireman; then as engineer of the Overland
Express; and finally as Train Dispatcher.</p>

<p>In this line of books there is revealed the whole workings
of a great American railroad system. There are adventures
in abundance—railroad wrecks, dashes through forest fires, the
pursuit of a “wildcat” locomotive, the disappearance of a
pay car with a large sum of money on board—but there is
much more than this—the intense rivalry among railroads and
railroad men, the working out of running schedules, the getting
through “on time” in spite of all obstacles, and the
manipulation of railroad securities by evil men who wish to
rule or ruin.</p>
